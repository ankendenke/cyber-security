The [[Linux]] Incident Surface, refers to all the system areas involved in the detection, management, and response to an actual security incident (post-compromise). It includes where security breaches may be detected and analyzed and where a response plan must be implemented to mitigate the incident.

The main purpose of identifying the incident surface is to hunt down, detect, respond to, and recover from the incident if it has occurred. A security analyst would monitor all areas within the operating system where any traces or footprints of the attack could be found. Some of the key points where we could find the incident traces are highlighted below:

- System logs
- auth.log, syslog, krnl.log, etc
- Network traffic
- Running processes
- Running services
- The integrity of the files and processes

Understanding the incident surface is key to efficiently responding to an ongoing attack, mitigating damage, recovering affected systems, and applying lessons learned to prevent future incidents.
