Regardless of the evolution of automating the majority of security tasks, the **People** in a SOC will always be important. A security solution can generate numerous red flags in a SOC environment, which can cause huge noise.

Imagine you are part of a fire brigade team and have centralized software where all the city’s fire alarms are integrated. Suppose you get many fire notifications at once, all for different places. When you get into those locations, your team finds out most of those were only triggered by excessive smoke from cooking. Eventually, all the efforts will be a waste of time and resources.

In a SOC, with security solutions in place without human intervention, you'll end up focusing on more irrelevant issues. There are always the **People** who help the security solution to identify truly harmful activities and enable a prompt response.

The **People** are known as the SOC team. This team has the following roles and responsibilities.

- **SOC Analyst (Level 1):** Anything detected by the security solution would pass through these analysts first. These are the first responders to any detection. SOC Level 1 Analysts perform basic alert triage to determine if a specific detection is harmful. They also report these detections through proper channels.
- ****SOC Analyst (Level 2)**:** While Level 1 does the first-level analysis, some detections may require deeper investigation. Level 2 Analysts help them dive deeper into the investigations and correlate the data from multiple data sources to perform a proper analysis.
- ****SOC Analyst (Level 3)**:** Level 3 Analysts are experienced professionals who proactively look for any threat indicators and support in the incident response activities. The critical severity detection reported by Level 1 and Level 2 Analysts are often security incidents that need detailed responses, including containment, eradication, and recovery. This is where Level 3 analysts’ experience comes in handy.
- **Security Engineer:** All analysts work on security solutions. These solutions need deployment and configuration. Security Engineers deploy and configure these security solutions to ensure their smooth operation.
- **Detection Engineer:** Security rules are the logic built behind security solutions to detect harmful activities. Level 2 and 3 Analysts often create these rules, while the SOC team can sometimes also utilize the detection engineer role independently for this responsibility.
- **SOC Manager:** The SOC Manager manages the processes the SOC team follows and provides support. The SOC Manager also remains in contact with the organization’s CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) to provide him with updates on the SOC team’s current security posture and efforts.

**Note:** The roles in the SOC team can increase or decrease depending on the size and criticality of the organizations.
