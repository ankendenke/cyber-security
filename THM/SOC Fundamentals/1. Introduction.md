Technology has made our lives more efficient, but with this efficiency comes more responsibility. Modern-day fears have come a long way from the exploitation of physical assets. The critical data, called secrets, are no longer stored in physical files. Organizations carry tons of confidential data in their network and systems. Any unauthorized disruption, loss, or modification to this data may cause them a huge damage. Threat actors discover and exploit new vulnerabilities in these networks and systems daily, becoming a major concern in cyber security. Traditional security practices may not be enough to prevent many of these threats. Dedicating a whole team to managing your organization’s security is important.

A **SOC** (**S**ecurity **O**perations **C**enter) is a dedicated facility operated by a specialized security team. This team aims to continuously monitor an organization’s network and resources and identify suspicious activity to prevent damage. This team works 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

This room will delve into some key concepts of SOC, one of the most important fields in defensive security.
