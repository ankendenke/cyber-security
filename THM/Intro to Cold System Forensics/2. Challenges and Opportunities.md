### Historical Context: The Evolution of Cold System Forensics

In our cyber security journey, forensics plays a crucial role in gathering evidence and putting together the puzzle of a breach. While live forensics tackles actively running systems, cold system forensics focuses on dormant or powered-off machines, aiming to preserve the system's state and any potential evidence.

Cold system forensics emerged as a direct response to a malicious technique known as a **cold boot attack**. Attackers would use this technique to take advantage of the fact that data in a computer's RAM persists for a short period, depending on the RAM's temperature, after the system is powered off. The cooler the RAM chips are, the longer the data can be retained. Attackers could rapidly reboot a compromised machine to access sensitive information, such as encryption keys, passwords, or in-memory data, before it is completely erased.

To counter this threat, researchers began exploring methods to preserve and analyze the contents of a system's volatile memory even when powered off, marking the initiation of cold system forensics.

### Beyond Memory Analysis

Initially focused on memory analysis, cold system forensics has evolved into a discipline encompassing the examination of the entire dormant system. This includes storage drives, peripheral devices, hardware configurations, and any other residual data lingering in volatile memory after the system is shut down.

Analysis of a system in its powered-off state ensures that forensic analysts preserve the integrity of evidence, preventing potential tampering and modification. This is particularly crucial in legal proceedings where the admissibility of evidence hinges on its unaltered state.

### Cold vs. Live Forensics

To appreciate the unique value of cold system forensics, it is essential to contrast it with live forensics. Each approach has unique challenges and opportunities, and knowing when to apply each method can significantly impact an investigation's effectiveness.

### Common Scenarios for Cold System Forensics

Cold system forensics is particularly applicable in various scenarios:

- **Risk of modifying evidence**: As live analysis can alter critical evidence, cold system forensics must ensure the evidence remains unaltered and admissible in court. This can be seen during forensic investigations where any interaction with the running system could overwrite volatile data or change file timestamps, compromising the integrity of the evidence.
- **Comprehensive data capture**: This is necessary when a thorough examination of all data is necessary. It is essential for deep investigations where every piece of information matters, such as financial fraud investigations. By shutting down the system and creating a bit-by-bit image of the storage device, analysts can capture all the data, including deleted files, and analyze the system's complete state.
- **Incident response**: To preserve evidence from compromised systems without risk of alteration, shutting down a compromised server and performing cold analysis ensures the evidence remains intact. However, due to potential service disruptions, shutting down a compromised server in a large corporation running critical services might be avoided. Instead, forensic analysts might initially opt for live response techniques and later perform cold analysis on a cloned disk image to ensure no data is lost or modified.
- **Legal proceedings**: Cold system forensics ensures uncontaminated evidence that meets legal standards. Courts require a clear chain of custody and unaltered data, best achieved through cold analysis. When investigating intellectual property theft cases, demonstrating that the evidence was collected without any modification strengthens the case's credibility and legal standing.
- **Data recovery/File carving**: This process retrieves deleted or lost files from a system. Cold analysis allows for reconstructing deleted files from disk images without overlooking any data during recovery.
- **Legacy systems**: Where live analysis is not feasible due to outdated or unstable systems, cold system forensics is handy. Live analysis tools may not be supported in environments with legacy systems, such as older industrial control systems in manufacturing plants. Therefore, cold analysis allows forensic experts to examine these systems without risking further instability or data loss.
- **Cloud and virtualized environments**: In today's world, where cloud and virtualized environments are commonly used, cold system forensics can be used to analyze virtual machines without impacting running services. For example, a service provider might create snapshots of VMs suspected of being compromised, allowing analysts to analyze them and uncover any malice. This ensures that customer services remain uninterrupted while a thorough investigation is conducted.
