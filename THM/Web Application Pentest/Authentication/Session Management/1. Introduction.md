Â Thinking about your interactions with web applications, you should realise that you do not provide a web application with your username and password on every request. Instead, after authentication, you are provided with a session. This session is used by the web application to keep your state, track your actions, and decide whether or not you are allowed to do what you are trying to do. Session management aims to ensure that these steps are performed correctly. Otherwise, it may be possible for a threat actor to compromise your session and effectively hijack it!
