Authentication enumeration is a fundamental aspect of security testing, concentrating specifically on the mechanisms that protect sensitive aspects of web applications; this process involves methodically inspecting various authentication components ranging from username validation to password policies and session management. Each of these elements is meticulously tested because they represent potential vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could lead to significant security breaches.  

### Objectives

By the end of this room, you will:

1. Understand the significance of enumeration and how it sets the stage for effective brute-force attacks.
2. Learn advanced enumeration methods, mainly focusing on extracting information from verbose error messages.
3. Comprehend the relationship between enumeration and brute-force attacks in compromising authentication mechanisms.
4. Gain practical experience using tools and techniques for both enumeration and brute-force attacks.
