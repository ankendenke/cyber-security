First released in June 2011, WPScan has survived the tests of time and stood out as a tool that every pentester should have in their toolkits.

The WPScan framework is capable of enumerating & researching a few security vulnerability categories present in WordPress sites - including - but not limited to:

- Sensitive Information Disclosure (Plugin & Theme installation versions for disclosed vulnerabilities or CVE's)
- Path Discovery (Looking for misconfigured file permissions i.e. wp-config.php)
- Weak Password Policies (Password bruteforcing)
- Presence of Default Installation (Looking for default files)
- Testing Web Application Firewalls (Common WAF plugins)

### Installing WPScan  

# 

Thankfully for us, WPScan comes pre-installed on the latest versions of penetration testing systems such as Kali Linux and Parrot. If you are using an older version of Kali Linux (such as 2019) for example, WPScan is in the apt repository, so can be installed by a simple `sudo apt update && sudo apt install wpscan`

﻿Installing WPScan on other operating systems such as Ubuntu or Debian involves extra steps. Whilst the TryHackMe AttackBox comes pre-installed with WPScan, you can follow the [developer's installation guide](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan#install) for your local environment.  

# A Primer on WPScan's Database  

WPScan uses information within a local database as a primary reference point when enumerating for themes and plugins. As we'll come to detail later, a technique that WPScan uses when enumerating is looking for common themes and plugins. Before using WPScan, it is highly recommended that you update this database before performing any scans.

Thankfully, this is an easy process to do. Simply run `wpscan --update`
