Welcome to the Gobuster portion of this room! This part of the room is aimed at complete beginners to enumeration and penetration testing. By completing this portion, you will have learned:

- How to install Gobuster on Kali Linux
- How to use the "dir" mode to enumerate directories and several of its most useful options
- How to use the "dns" mode to enumerate domains/subdomains and several of its most useful option
- Where to go for help

At the end of this section, you will have the opportunity to practice what you have learned by using Gobuster on another room, _[Blog](https://tryhackme.com/room/blog)._ This room utilizes what's called a Content Management System (CMS) in order to make things easier for the user. These typically have large and varied directory structures...perfect for directory enumeration with Gobuster!

With the introduction out of the way, let's get started!

# What is Gobuster?

# 

As the name implies, Gobuster is written in [Go](https://golang.org/). Go is an open-source, low-level language (much like C or Rust) developed by a team at Google and other contributors. If you'd like to learn more about Go, visit the website linked above.

### Installing Gobuster on Kali Linux

# 

  
Luckily, installing Gobuster on Kali Linux does not require any installation of Go and does not carry with it a complicated install process. This means no building from source or running any other complicated commands. Ready?

`sudo apt install gobuster`

Done.

# Useful Global Flags

There are some useful Global flags that can be used as well. I've included them in the table below. You can review these in the main documentation as well - [here](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).

  

|Flag|Long Flag|Description|
|---|---|---|
|-t|--threads|Number of concurrent threads (default 10)|
|-v|--verbose|Verbose output|
|-z|--no-progress|Don't display progress|
|-q|--quiet|Don't print the banner and other noise|
|-o|--output|Output file to write results to|

I will typically change the number of threads to 64 to increase the speed of my scans. If you don't change the number of threads, Gobuster can be a little slow.
