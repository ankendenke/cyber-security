# Introduction to Nikto

Initially released in 2001, Nikto has made leaps and bounds over the years and has proven to be a very popular vulnerability scanner due to being both open-source nature and feature-rich. Nikto is capable of performing an assessment on all types of webservers (and isn't application-specific such as WPScan.). Nikto can be used to discover possible vulnerabilities including:

- Sensitive files
- Outdated servers and programs (i.e. [vulnerable web server installs](https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html))
- Common server and software misconfigurations (Directory indexing, cgi scripts, x-ss protections)

### Installing Nikto  

# 

Thankfully for us, Nikto comes pre-installed on the latest versions of penetration testing systems such as Kali Linux and Parrot. If you are using an older version of Kali Linux (such as 2019) for example, Nikto is in the apt repository, so can be installed by a simple `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nikto`

﻿Installing Nikto on other operating systems such as Ubuntu or Debian involves extra steps. Whilst the TryHackMe AttackBox comes pre-installed with Nikto, you can follow the [developer's installation guide](https://cirt.net/nikto2-docs/installation.html#id2780292) for your local environment.
