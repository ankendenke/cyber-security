There are many useful wordlists to use for each mode. These may or may not come in handy later on during the VM portion of the room! I'll go over some of the ones that are on Kali by default as well as a short section on SecLists.

### **Kali Linux Default Lists**

Below you will find a useful list of wordlists that are installed on Kali Linux by default. This is as of the latest version at the time of writing which is **2020.3**. Anything with a wildcard (*) character indicates there's more than one list that matches. Keep in mind, a lot of these can be interchanged between modes. For example, "dir" mode wordlists (such as ones from the dirbuster directory) will contain words like "admin", "index", "about", "events", etc. A lot of these could be subdomains as well. Give them a try with the different modes!  
  

- /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-*.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/small.txt
- /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/extensions_common.txt - Useful for when fuzzing for files!

### **Non-Standard Lists**

In addition to the above, Daniel Miessler has created an amazing GitHub repo called [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists). It compiles many different lists used for many different things. The best part is, it's in apt! You can `sudo apt install seclists` and get the entire repo! We won't dive into any other lists as there are many. However, between what's installed by default on Kali and the SecLists repo, I doubt you'll need anything else.
