## Key Properties That Make Hash Functions Secure

To see why hashes are so widely used in security, let's break down the key features:

- **Pre-image Resistance**: If someone sees the hash, they shouldn't be able to figure out what the original input was. This is critical for things like password storage, where even if an attacker gets their hands on a hash, they still can't reverse it to get the original password.
- **Second Pre-image Resistance**: If someone has both a message and its hash, it should be very difficult to find a different message that produces the same hash. This makes sure no one can tamper with the data and make it seem like everything is still intact.
- **Collision Resistance**: A hash function is designed so that it is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash. While collisions (different inputs with the same hash) theoretically exist, the goal is to make it practically impossible for an attacker to identify such collisions within a reasonable time frame. Without collision resistance, the assurance of data integrity provided by hashes would be compromised.

## Where Are Hash Functions Used?

Hash functions are at work in more places than you might realize:

1. **File Integrity Checks**: When you download a file, like software or an update, you might notice that a hash is provided for you to verify the download. You compare the hash of the downloaded file with the one provided by the developer—if they match, the file hasn't been tampered with.
2. **Storing Passwords**: When you create a password, websites don't store it directly. Instead, they hash it and store the hash. When you try to log in, the system hashes the password you enter and checks if it matches the stored hash. This way, even if the password database is compromised, attackers don't get your actual password.
3. **Digital Signatures and Certificates**: Hashes ensure that documents or transactions haven't been altered. For example, in email encryption or SSL certificates, hash functions verify that data has remained unchanged and trustworthy.

## Vulnerabilities in Hash Functions

Even though hash functions are generally secure, not all of them are created equal. Older hash functions like **MD5** and **SHA-1** have known vulnerabilities that make them susceptible to attacks. One such attack is the **Length Extension Attack**, which allows an attacker to take an existing hash and extend it by adding a suffix, predicting the hash of the original message with extra data appended. Crucially, this can be done without needing to know the key used in the hash. Throughout this room, we'll see how this attack works and explore different scenarios where it can be exploited.
