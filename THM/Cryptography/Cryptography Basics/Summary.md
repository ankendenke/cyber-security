In this room, we learned about the importance of cryptography and some of the problems that it solves. We also introduced symmetric and asymmetric encryption ciphers. Finally, we explained the XOR and the modulo operations. In the next room, [Public Key Cryptography Basics](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/publickeycrypto), we will visit various asymmetric cryptosystems and see how they solve the problems we face in the digital world.
