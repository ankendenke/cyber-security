The two main categories of encryption are **symmetric** and **asymmetric**.

## Symmetric Encryption

**Symmetric encryption**, also known as **symmetric cryptography**, uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data, as shown in the figure below. Keeping the key secret is a must; it is also called **private key cryptography**. Furthermore, communicating the key to the intended parties can be challenging as it requires a secure communication channel. Maintaining the secrecy of the key can be a significant challenge, especially if there are many recipients. The problem becomes more severe in the presence of a powerful adversary; consider the threat of industrial espionage, for instance.

Consider the simple case where you created a password-protected document to share it with your colleague. You can easily email the encrypted document to your colleague, but most likely, you cannot email them the password. The reason is that anyone with access to their mailbox would access both the password-protected document and its password. Therefore, you need to think of a different way, i.e., channel, to share the password. Unless you think of a secure, accessible channel, one solution would be to meet in person and communicate the password to them.

Examples of symmetric encryption are DES (Data Encryption Standard), 3DES (Triple DES) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

- **DES** was adopted as a standard in 1977 and uses a 56-bit key. With the advancement in computing power, in 1999, a DES key was successfully broken in less than 24 hours, motivating the shift to 3DES.
- **3DES** is DES applied three times; consequently, the key size is 168 bits, though the effective security is 112 bits. 3DES was more of an ad-hoc solution when DES was no longer considered secure. 3DES was deprecated in 2019 and should be replaced by AES; however, it may still be found in some legacy systems.
- **AES** was adopted as a standard in 2001. Its key size can be 128, 192, or 256 bits.

There are many more symmetric encryption ciphers used in various applications; however, they have not been adopted as standards.

## Asymmetric Encryption

Unlike symmetric encryption, which uses the same key for encryption and decryption, **asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other to decrypt, as shown in the illustration below. To protect confidentiality, asymmetric encryption or **asymmetric cryptography** encrypts the data using the public key; hence, it is also called **public key cryptography**.

![Asymmetric encryption uses the recipient's public key for encryption and the recipient's private key for decryption.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1725293946043.svg)  

Examples are RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve cryptography (ECC). The two keys involved in the process are referred to as a **public key** and a **private key**. Data encrypted with the public key can be decrypted with the private key. Your private key needs to be kept private, hence the name.

Asymmetric encryption tends to be slower, and many asymmetric encryption ciphers use larger keys than symmetric encryption. For example, RSA uses 2048-bit, 3072-bit, and 4096-bit keys; 2048-bit is the recommended minimum key size. Diffie-Hellman also has a recommended minimum key size of 2048 bits but uses 3072-bit and 4096-bit keys for enhanced security. On the other hand, ECC can achieve equivalent security with shorter keys. For example, with a 256-bit key, ECC provides a level of security comparable to a 3072-bit RSA key.

Asymmetric encryption is based on a particular group of mathematical problems that are easy to compute in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse. In this context, extremely difficult means practically infeasible. For example, we can rely on a mathematical problem that would take a very long time, for example, millions of years, to solve using today’s technology.

We will visit various asymmetric encryption ciphers in the next room. For now, the important thing to note is that asymmetric encryption provides you with a public key that you share with everyone and a private key that you keep guarded and secret.

## Summary of New Terms

- **Alice and Bob** are fictional characters commonly used in cryptography examples to represent two parties trying to communicate securely. **Symmetric encryption** is a method in which the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Consequently, this key must remain secure and never be disclosed to anyone except the intended party. **Asymmetric encryption** is a method that uses two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
