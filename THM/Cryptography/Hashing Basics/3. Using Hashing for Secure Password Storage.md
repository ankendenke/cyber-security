This is where hashing comes in. What if, instead of storing the password, you just stored its hash value using a secure hashing function? This process means you never have to store the user’s password, and if your database is leaked, an attacker will have to crack each password to find out what the password was.

There’s just one problem with this. What if two users have the same password? As a hash function will always turn the same input into the same output, you will store the same password hash for each user. That means if someone cracks that hash, they gain access to more than one account. It also means someone can create a Rainbow Table to break the hashes.

A **Rainbow Table** is a lookup table of hashes to plaintexts, so you can quickly find out what password a user had just from the hash. A rainbow table trades the time to crack a hash for hard disk space, but it takes time to create. Here’s a quick example to get an idea of what a rainbow table looks like.

Websites like [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) and [Hashes.com](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash) internally use massive rainbow tables to provide fast password cracking for **hashes without salts**. Doing a lookup in a sorted list of hashes is quicker than trying to crack the hash.

### Protecting Against Rainbow Tables

To protect against rainbow tables, we add a salt to the passwords. The salt is a randomly generated value stored in the database and should be unique to each user. In theory, you could use the same salt for all users, but duplicate passwords would still have the same hash and a rainbow table could still be created for passwords with that salt.

The salt is added to either the start or the end of the password before it’s hashed, and this means that every user will have a different password hash even if they have the same password. Hash functions like Bcrypt and Scrypt handle this automatically. Salts don’t need to be kept private.

### Example of Securely Storing Passwords

You can find many good guides online that promote best security practices when storing passwords. Please check if there are any standards you need to follow when storing passwords before adopting one. Consider this example following good security practices when storing user passwords:

1. We select a secure hashing function, such as Argon2, Scrypt, Bcrypt, or PBKDF2.
2. We add a unique salt to the password, such as `Y4UV*^(=go_!`
3. Concatenate the password with the unique salt. For example, if the password is `AL4RMc10k`, the result string would be `AL4RMc10kY4UV*^(=go_!`
4. Calculate the hash value of the combined password and salt. In this example, using the chosen algorithm, you need to calculate the hash value of `AL4RMc10kY4UV*^(=go_!`.
5. Store the hash value and the unique salt used (`Y4UV*^(=go_!`).

### Using Encryption to Store Passwords

Considering the problem of saving passwords for authentication, why don’t we encrypt passwords instead of all these cumbersome steps? The reason is that even if we select a secure hashing algorithm to encrypt the passwords before storing them, we still need to store the used key. Consequently, if someone gets the key, they can easily decrypt all the passwords.
