Understanding processes, services, and cronjobs is fundamental to understanding the inner workings of Linux systems. Each component has a distinct role within the system's overall functionality, from executing scheduled tasks to providing services to automate routine operations and enable user interaction. However, their crucial roles bring the potential for exploitation by malicious actors that have gained a foothold in the system. Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to escalate privileges, move laterally, establish persistent footholds, or install backdoors, further compromising the integrity and security of the system. As such, building a solid arsenal of forensic analysis techniques is increasingly important to effectively detect and mitigate threats against these components.

Objectives

- Learn how to perform live forensic analysis on Linux systems, focused on determining malicious processes, services, and scripts.
- Understand how to identify common artefacts, log mechanisms, and process and service-related activities in Linux.
- Hunt malicious processes, services, and configurations to mitigate further compromise in a hands-on IR scenario.
