The last process we'll look at is **Windows Explorer**, **explorer.exe**. This process gives the user access to their folders and files. It also provides functionality for other features, such as the Start Menu and Taskbar.

  

As mentioned previously, the Winlogon process runs userinit.exe, which launches the value in `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`. Userinit.exe exits after spawning explorer.exe. Because of this, the parent process is non-existent. 

  

There will be many child processes for explorer.exe.

What is normal?

  

![Explorer.exe properties.](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/windows-processes/explorer.png)  

  

**Image Path**:  %SystemRoot%\explorer.exe

**Parent Process**:  Created by userinit.exe and exits

**Number of Instances**:  One or more per interactively logged-in user

**User Account**:  Logged-in user(s)

**Start Tim**e:  First instance when the first interactive user logon session begins

  

What is unusual?

- An actual parent process. (userinit.exe calls this process and exits)
- Image file path other than C:\Windows
- Running as an unknown user
- Subtle misspellings to hide rogue processes in plain sight
- Outbound TCP/IP connections
