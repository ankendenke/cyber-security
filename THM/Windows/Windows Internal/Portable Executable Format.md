Executables and applications are a large portion of how Windows internals operate at a higher level. The PE (Portable Executable) format defines the information about the executable and stored data. The PE format also defines the structure of how data components are stored.

The PE (Portable Executable) format is an overarching structure for executable and object files. The PE (Portable Executable) and COFF (Common Object File Format) files make up the PE format.


PE data is most commonly seen in the hex dump of an executable file. Below we will break down a hex dump of calc.exe into the sections of PE data.

The structure of PE data is broken up into seven components,

The DOS Header defines the type of file

The MZ DOS header defines the file format as .exe. The DOS header can be seen in the hex dump section below.

The DOS Stub is a program run by default at the beginning of a file that prints a compatibility message. This does not affect any functionality of the file for most users.

The DOS stub prints the message This program cannot be run in DOS mode. The DOS stub can be seen in the hex dump section below.

The PE File Header provides PE header information of the binary. Defines the format of the file, contains the signature and image file header, and other information headers.

The PE file header is the section with the least human-readable output. You can identify the start of the PE file header from the PE stub in the hex dump section below.

The Image Optional Header has a deceiving name and is an important part of the PE File Header

The Data Dictionaries are part of the image optional header. They point to the image data directory structure.


The Section Table will define the available sections and information in the image. As previously discussed, sections store the contents of the file, such as code, imports, and data. You can identify each section definition from the table in the hex dump section below.

Now that the headers have defined the format and function of the file, the sections can define the contents and data of the file.

Section
Purpose
.text
Contains executable code and entry point
.data 
Contains initialized data (strings, variables, etc.)
.rdata or .idata
Contains imports (Windows API) and DLLs.
.reloc
Contains relocation information
.rsrc
Contains application resources (images, etc.)
.debug
Contains debug information
