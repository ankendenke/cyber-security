Now that we have run Powershell commands, let's try to write and run a script to do more complex and powerful actions. 

For this ask, we'll use Powershell ISE (the Powershell Text Editor). Let's use a particular scenario to show an example of this script. Given a list of port numbers, we want to use this list to see if the local port is listening. Open the listening-ports.ps1 script on the Desktop using Powershell ISE. Powershell scripts usually have the _**.ps1**_ file extension. 

```powershell
$system_ports = Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen

$text_port = Get-Content -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\ports.txt

foreach($port in $text_port){

    if($port -in $system_ports.LocalPort){
        echo $port
     }

}
```

On the first line, we want to get a list of all the ports on the system that are listening. We do this using the `Get-NetTCPConnection` _cmdlet_. We are then saving the output of this _cmdlet_ into a variable. The convention to create variables is used as:

```powershell
$variable_name = value
```

In the following line, we want to read a list of ports from the file. We do this using the `Get-Content` _cmdlet._ Again, we store this output in the variables. The simplest next step is to iterate through all the ports in the file to see if the ports are listening. To iterate through the ports in the file, we use the following:

```powershell
foreach($new_var in $existing_var){}
```

This particular code block is used to loop through a set of objects. Once we have each individual port, we want to check if this port occurs in the listening local ports. Instead of doing another _for_ loop, we just use an _if_ statement with the `-in` operator to check if the port exists in the `LocalPort` property of any object. A full list of _if_ statement comparison operators can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators?view=powershell-6). To run the script, call the script path using Powershell or click the green button on Powershell ISE:

Now that we've seen what a basic script looks like - it's time to write one of your own. The emails folder on the Desktop contains copies of the emails John, Martha, and Mary have been sending to each other(and themselves). Answer the following questions with regard to these emails (try not to open the files and use a script to answer the questions).   

Scripting may be a bit difficult, but [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/powershell/) is a good resource to use:
