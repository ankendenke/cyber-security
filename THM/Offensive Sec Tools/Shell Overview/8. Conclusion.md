In this room, we learned about **Reverse Shells**, **Bind Shells**, and **Web Shells**, how they are critical for attackers, penetration testers, and defenders, and how to identify them.  

**Reverse Shells** establish a connection from a compromised machine back to an attacker's system. **Bind Shells**, on the other hand, listen for incoming connections on a compromised machine, and **Web Shells** offer attackers a unique avenue for exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.

Understanding shells is critical for security professionals to either perform penetration testing exercises or to identify and defend systems.
