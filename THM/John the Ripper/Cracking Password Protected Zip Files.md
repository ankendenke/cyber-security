## Zip2John

Similarly to the `unshadow` tool we used previously, we will use the `zip2john` tool to convert the Zip file into a hash format that John can understand and hopefully crack. The primary usage is like this:

`zip2john [options] [zip file] > [output file]`

- `[options]`: Allows you to pass specific checksum options to `zip2john`; this shouldn’t often be necessary
- `[zip file]`: The path to the Zip file you wish to get the hash of
- `>`: This redirects the output from this command to another file
- `[output file]`: This is the file that will store the output

**Example Usage**

`zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt`

## Cracking

We’re then able to take the file we output from `zip2john` in our example use case, `zip_hash.txt`, and, as we did with `unshadow`, feed it directly into John as we have made the input specifically for it.

`john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt zip_hash.txt`
