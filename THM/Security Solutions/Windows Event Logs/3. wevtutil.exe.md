Ok, you played around with Event Viewer. Imagine you have to sit there and manually sift through hundreds or even thousands of events (even after filtering the log). Not fun. It would be nice if you could write scripts to do this work for you. We will explore some tools that will allow you to query event logs via the command line and/or PowerShell.

Let's look at **wevtutil.exe** first. Per Microsoft, the wevtutil.exe tool "enables you to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. You can also use this command to install and uninstall event manifests, to run queries, and to export, archive, and clear logs."

As with any tool, access its help files to find out how to run the tool. An example of a command to do this is `wevtutil.exe /?`.

Powershell- wevtutil.exe

```shell-source
PS> C:\Users\Administrator> wevtutil.exe /?
Windows Events Commandline Utility.
Enables you to retrieve information about event logs and publishers, install and uninstall event manifests, run queries, and export, archive and clear logs.

Usage:

You can use either the short (for example, ep /uni) or long (for example, enum-publishers /unicode) version of the command and option names. Commands, options and option values are not case-sensitive.

Variables are noted in all upper-case.

wevtutil COMMAND [ARGUMENT [ARGUMENT] ...] [/OPTION:VALUE [/OPTION:VALUE] ...]

Commands:

el  | enum-logs              List log names.

```

From the above snippet, under **Usage**, you are provided a brief example of how to use the tool. In this example, `ep` (**enum-publishers**) is used. This is a **command** for wevtutil.exe.

Below, we can find the **Common options** that can be used with Windows Events Utility.

Powershell- wevtutil.exe

```shell-source

To learn more about a specific command, type the following:

wevtutil COMMAND /?
      
```

Notice at the bottom of the above snapshot, `wevtutil COMMAND /?`. This will provide additional information specific to a command. We can use it to get more information on the command `qe` (**query-events**).

Powershell- wevtutil.exe

```shell-source
PS> C:\Users\Administrator> wevtutil qe /?
Read events from an event log, log file or using a structured query.

Usage:

wevtutil {qe | query-events}  [/OPTION:VALUE [/OPTION:VALUE]...]
      
```

Look over the information within the help menu to fully understand how to use this command.
