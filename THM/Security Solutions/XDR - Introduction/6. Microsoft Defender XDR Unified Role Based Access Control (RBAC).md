**Microsoft Defender XDR unified role-based access control** (RBAC) is a centralized permissions management system that streamlines access management across the Defender security ecosystem. It provides a single interface for administrators to manage who can access what across the Microsoft Defender XDR. It unifies access control across endpoints, identities, email, cloud apps, and data based on assigned roles and responsibilities.

To get started with Microsoft Defender XDR unified role-based access control (RBAC), it needs to be activated before you can start configuring and managing role permissions for other security team members. It is worth noting that the number of workloads available for activation is determined by the license available on your tenant.

**Note:** To follow through, you can use the labe credentials and URL below:

You can activate your workloads in the following ways:

**From the Permissions and Roles Page**

- On the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/)
- Select permissions on the navigation pane
- Select Roles under Microsoft Defender XDR

On the **Permissions and roles** screen, select **Activate workloads** (1) to show a sidebar where you can select each toggle to activate a workload. In some cases, you may not see the **Activate workloads** option because another administrator may have cancelled it. Also, remember that the **Workloads** options you see are determined by the license currently available for your tenant.

As a second option, select **Workload settings** (2) back on the **permission and roles** screen. This takes you to the Microsoft Defender XDR Permission and Roles page. 

- Select the toggle for the workload to activate it.

**From the Microsoft Defender XDR Settings**

- On the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/)
- Select **Settings** on the navigation pane
- Select **Microsoft Defender XDR**
- Select **Permissions and roles**
- On the Activate workloads page, select the toggle for the workload you want to activate

See the [Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/custom-permissions-details) permission details for more information on the list of permissions available to configure for admins based on their roles and tasks.

During our lab task, we will navigate the Defender portal and review creating custom RBAC roles.
