Before discussing the different Microsoft XDR settings, let's consider a typical cyber security attack and how Microsoft Defender XDR would help detect and remediate it.

The cyber-attack described above begins with a phishing email delivered to an employee's inbox in your organization. The employee opens the email attachment unknowingly, which then deploys malware on the user's device, potentially triggering a series of attack attempts that may culminate in the theft of sensitive information.

Let's consider the following with respect to the attack attempt scenario above from left to right:

1. **Exchange Online Protection**, a component of Microsoft Defender for Office 365, can identify phishing emails and apply **mail flow** rules (also known as **transport rules**) to ensure they do not reach a user's Inbox.
2. **Defender for Office 365** can also use it **Safe Attachments** and **Safe Links** feature to evaluate attachments and links in an email and ascertain whether they are harmful. This ensures that the emails that come through are either not actionable for the user or are blocked from being delivered by established policies.
3. To prevent the exploitation of malware-infected devices, Defender for Endpoint can identify and remediate vulnerabilities on devices and networks before the attacker exploits them on organization-managed devices.
4. **Defender for Identity** will monitor and flag sudden changes to on-premises user accounts, such as unauthorized privilege escalation or risky lateral movements, for security teams to investigate. It also highlights commonly exploited identity vulnerabilities, like unconstrained Kerberos delegation, so the security team can investigate and mitigate them.
5. Finally, **Defender for Cloud Apps** can prevent attackers from exfiltrating sensitive data,  it n detect unusual behaviors such as impossible travel, credential theft, atypical activities, usual file downloads and sharing, or email forwarding and report these incidents to the security team for further investigation.

## Microsoft Defender XDR Settings

The Microsoft Defender portal has settings for each product. However, to manage Defender XDR settings, navigate to Settings and then select Microsoft Defender XDR.

On the Microsoft Defender XDR settings page, you can configure the following:

- **Email notifications**: Enables security teams to set up email notifications for incidents, response actions, and threat analytics reports.
- **Alert service settings**: Enables you to determine which identity protection alerts will appear on the alerts and incidents page.
- **Permissions and roles**: On this tab, you can configure a centralized permissions management solution to control user access and permissions across different Microsoft security solutions. We will discuss this further in the next task.
- **Streaming API**: Security trams can ship event data directly to Azure Event hubs for consumption by visualization services, data processing engines, third-party SIEM solutions or Azure storage for long-term data retent.
- **Asset rule management**: enables you to create rules for assets and decide which actions will apply to them.
- **Alert tuning:** Previously known as alert suppression, it allows security teams to tune and manage alerts in advance.
- **Critical asset management**: can be configured to manage the criticality level of the organization's assets to predefined classifications or by creating your own custom ones.
- **Identity automated response**: Used to exclude users from automated response actions.
