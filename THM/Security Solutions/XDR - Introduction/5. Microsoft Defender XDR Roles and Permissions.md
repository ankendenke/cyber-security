Controlling users' permissions and access to view and manage the security controls associated with Microsoft Defender it is crucial for organizations to ensure the least privilege and minimize the risks associated with unauthorized access.

By default, access to services in the Microsoft Defender portal can be managed collectively using Microsoft Entra global roles. However, if more flexibility and control over access to specific product data are required, security teams can create custom roles for each Microsoft Defender service. If a centralized permissions management console is required, then it's recommended that Microsoft Defender XDR Unified role-based access control (RBAC) be configured.

As mentioned above, access and management of Microsoft Defender XDR can be managed in three different ways:

**Using Microsoft Entra Global Roles**

Accounts with these Microsoft Entra roles can access Microsoft Defender XDR settings, features, and security control.

- Global Administrator
- Security Administrator
- Security Operator
- Global Reader
- Security Reader

**Configuring Custom Roles for Specific Microsoft Defender Product**

For instance, the security admin can create custom roles for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, allowing them to control what can be configured or modified on Defender for Endpoint devices. Alternatively, the security admin can create custom roles for Microsoft Defender for Office to manage access and control configurations for specific email and collaboration settings.

It is always recommended that you configure roles with the least privilege. Here is an example role settings for Microsoft Defender for Endpoints **Endpoint roles & groups (2)**
