Traditional security tools such as antivirus, firewalls, and even Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) often operate in silos. While EDR focuses only on endpoint data and Network Detection and Response (NDR) focuses on Network data, Extended Detection and Response (XDR) enhances this detection and response capabilities by integrating data from various sources and automating the data correlation and analysis process. This significantly improves the accuracy of threat detection and reduces the time it takes to respond to incidents.

This room will introduce you to Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft’s unified security platform designed to provide integrated protection across endpoints, identities, emails, apps, and cloud resources. You will learn to detect, investigate, and respond to threats using data integrated from other Microsoft 365 Defender products and services.
