## Context

As part of your organization's policy to ensure zero trust and least privilege permissions, you have been tasked to review Microsoft Defender XDR Role-based access control.

**Task 1: Review Custom Role Creation in Microsoft Defender**

The steps below are meant to guide you through creating custom roles in Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC. You will not be creating any roles.

- Sign in to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/).
- In the navigation pane, select **Permissions**.
- Select **Roles** under Microsoft Defender XDR to get to the Permissions and roles page.
- Select **Create custom role**.
- Enter a random **Role name**.
- Select Next to choose the permission group you want to assign.

**Permission group** are organized into three different categories:

- **Security operations**: This permission is for security administrators who perform security operations and respond to incidents and advisories.

- **Security posture**: This permission is for security administrators who need to act on security recommendations and track remediation tasks, exceptions, and vulnerabilities.

- **Authorization and settings**: This permission is for security administrators who are in charge of configuring security controls and system settings and creating and assigning roles.

Feel free to click on the explanation icon to review each role permission. Select any role permissions; it doesn’t matter which one, as it’s just for demonstration purposes.

- Once you have selected the permissions, select Apply and Next to assign users and data sources.
- Select **Create assignments** or **Add assignment** and add the Assignment name.
- Under **Employees**, choose the team member to assign the configured permission group.
- Under **Data sources**, choose if the assigned users will have the selected permissions across all the available products or only for specific data sources.

- Click on cancel and confirm to head back to the Permission and role screen.

**Note:** In Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC, you can create multiple assignments under a single role while keeping the same permissions. For instance, you could create one assignment within a role that grants access to all data sources and a different assignment for a team that requires access solely to Endpoint alerts from the Defender for Endpoint data sources. This approach ensures maintaining a minimal number of roles per administrator.
