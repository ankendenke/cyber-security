Since Microsoft Defender XDR is a cloud-based, unified enterprise defense suite, it seamlessly combines data on cyberattacks across identities, endpoints, email, and cloud apps into a single platform. It leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to prevent and respond to threats, automatically stopping certain attacks and restoring affected assets across multiple domains. Microsoft Defender XDR is able to assess the complete extent and effect of these threats, such as their entry point, what they have impacted, and their ongoing influence on the organization. It’s important to highlight that these signals extend beyond just the products mentioned below.

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Microsoft Entra ID Protection

The architecture and integration of Microsoft Defender XDR components.

As seen in the architectiral image above, Microsoft Defender XDR integrates signals from all Defender components to deliver extended detection and response (XDR) across various domains. This includes a centralized incident and alert queue, automated responses to stop attacks, self-healing capabilities for compromised devices, user identities, and mailboxes, and cross-threat hunting and threat analysis. 

- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** protects your organization from harmful threats associated with email messages, links (URLs), and collaborative tools. It relays signals from these threats to Microsoft Defender XDR. Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is integrated to ensure comprehensive protection for incoming emails and attachments.
- **Microsoft Defender for Identity** collects signals from Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controllers, Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) and Entra Connect servers. It leverages these signals to secure your hybrid identity environment, including defending against attackers who exploit compromised accounts to navigate laterally across devices within the on-premises environment.
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** offers endpoint detection and response (EDR), antivirus, and vulnerability management. It collects signals from organization devices and sends them to Microsoft Defender XDR, which in turn provides advanced monitoring and protection for those devices.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** gathers signals related to the organization’s usage of cloud applications. It ensures secured data communication between your IT infrastructure and these applications, covering sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud apps. 
- **Microsoft Entra ID Protection** evaluates risky event data from billions of sign-in attempts to determine the risk level of each sign-in to your environment. Based on the conditions and restrictions of your Conditional Access policies, Microsoft Entra ID uses this evaluated risk data to either allow or prevent user access. It is worth noting that Microsoft Entra ID Protection operates independently from Microsoft Defender XDR as it is not part of the Microsoft Defender product suite but also shares signals with Microsoft Defender XDR.

## How Microsoft Defender XDR Works

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how Microsoft Defender XDR works and its core components

**Data Collection and Integration**

Defender XDR gathers and consolidates data from multiple sources, including endpoints (Defender for Endpoint), identities (Defender for Identity), email (Defender for Office 365), and cloud applications (Defender for Cloud Apps). The collected data is then enriched and correlated in real time to offer actionable insights, enabling security teams to prioritize incidents effectively.

**Threat Detection and An****alysis**

Defender XDR uses advanced analytics, machine learning models, and global threat intelligence to analyze collected data and detect known and emerging threats, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and anomalous user or system behaviours that may signal potential threats in their early stages. This allows Defender XDR to see the full scope of multi-stage attacks.

**Automated Incident Response**

Microsoft Defender XDR enables rapid threat containment and remediation through Automated Investigation and Remediation (AIR) for supported endpoints and mailboxes. It also offers Automatic Attack Disruption to stop lateral movement or ransomware in progress. It offers threat containment capabilities such as isolating machines, revoking tokens, disabling compromised accounts, and blocking malicious apps.

**Proactive Threat H****unting**

With Microsoft Defender XDR's advanced hunting feature, security teams can proactively hunt for threats using advanced Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries within a unified hunting interface, enabling deep, cross-domain investigation across all integrated Defender solutions.

**Orchestration**

Microsoft Defender XDR can integrate with security tools like Microsoft Sentinel to enhance orchestration and incident management. Its additional features, such as auto-tagging, alert prioritization, and role-based access control (RBAC), ensure efficient triage and response.
