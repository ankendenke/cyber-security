## Introduction

Have you ever wondered what makes HTTPS actually secure? What's going on behind the scenes when you click the lock? What's that button next to a URL? How does it all work? That's where Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) comes in.

PKI is the system that manages public key encryption, digital certificates, and trust. It keeps online communication secure and builds trust between users and websites. In this guide, we'll break down the key parts, protocols, and processes behind PKI, why it's important, and how it establishes trust. But first, let's do a quick refresher on public key cryptography.

## Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a system that uses two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is shared openly with others, while the private key stays secure with its owner. Anything encrypted with the public key can only be unlocked with the matching private key. This setup ensures both confidentiality and authenticity.

**Certificate Components**

Let's break down the key parts of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), starting with certificates. Think of certificates as digital ID cards that prove a person's identity, device, or website. In PKI, a certificate confirms that a specific public key belongs to its owner.

Here's a quick example: Look at the URL in your browser and click on the icon next to it. Depending on your browser, it might be a lock or a toggle icon. For this demo, we're using Chrome.

After that, click on the lock icon and the "**Connection is secure**" button (in Google Chrome); next, click on "**Certificate is valid**" to see the certificate's information.

It should show something like this:

The certificate viewer provides information about the website we are accessing, in this case, our very own TryHackMe. Here is a breakdown of the components: 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Common Name (CN)|This is the name of the entity for which the certificate was issued, for example, TryHackMe.|
|Organisation (O)|It shows the organisation to which the certificate has been issued, which may or may not be the website owner.|
|Validity Period|Also known as "cryptoperiod", it shows how long the certificate is valid. It shows when it was issued and when it expires.|
|SHA-256 Fingerprints|This is a unique identifier (like a fingerprint) for the certificate. A long series of letters and numbers makes the certificate easy to verify. The Public Key Fingerprint represents the unique identifier for the public key in the certificate.|

We just saw an example of a certificate, but how does it work, and how does it fit into PKI?
