Just like a map guides explorers, logs can be used to navigate system administrators and security analysts through the intricate world of Linux. This room equips you with essential skills to decipher these logs, focusing on core areas like logging levels, kernel whispers via `/var/log/kern.log`, user interactions, the watchful eye of auditd, the versatile syslog, and the modern journal. By the end, you'll be able to unearth hidden clues and safeguard your systems.

### Objectives
