The network tab on the developer tools can be used to keep track of every external request a webpage makes. If you click on the Network tab and then refresh the page, you'll see all the files the page is requesting. 

  

Try doing this on the contact page; you can press the trash can icon to delete the list if it gets a bit overpopulated.

  

With the network tab open, try filling in the contact form and pressing the **Send Message** button. You'll notice an event in the network tab, and this is the form being submitted in the background using a method called AJAX. AJAX is a method for sending and receiving network data in a web application background without interfering by changing the current web page.

Examine the new entry on the network tab that the contact form created and view the page the data was sent to in order to reveal a flag.
