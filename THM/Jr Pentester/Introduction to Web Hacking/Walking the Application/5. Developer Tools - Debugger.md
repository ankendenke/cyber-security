This panel in the developer tools is intended for debugging JavaScript, and again is an excellent feature for web developers wanting to work out why something might not be working. But as penetration testers, it gives us the option of digging deep into the JavaScript code. In Firefox and Safari, this feature is called Debugger, but in Google Chrome, it's called Sources.

  

On the Acme IT Support website, click on the contact page, each time the page is loaded, you might notice a rapid flash of red on the screen. We're going to use the Debugger to work out what this red flash is and if it contains anything interesting. Debugging a red dot wouldn't be something you'd do in the real world as a penetration tester, but it does allow us to use this feature and get used to the Debugger.

  

In both browsers, on the left-hand side, you see a list of all the resources the current webpage is using. If you click into the assets folder, you'll see a file named flash.min.js. Clicking on this file displays the contents of the JavaScript file.

  

Many times when viewing javascript files, you'll notice that everything is on one line, which is because it has been minimised, which means all formatting ( tabs, spacing and newlines ) have been removed to make the file smaller. This file is no exception to this, and it has also been obfusticated, which makes it purposely difficult to read, so it can't be copied as easily by other developers.

  

We can return some of the formattings by using the "Pretty Print" option, which looks like two braces { } to make it a little more readable, although due to the obfustication, it's still difficult to comprehend what is going on with the file. If you scroll to the bottom of the flash.min.js file, you'll see the line: `flash['remove']();`

This little bit of JavaScript is what is removing the red popup from the page. We can utilise another feature of debugger called **breakpoints**. These are points in the code that we can force the browser to stop processing the JavaScript and pause the current execution.
