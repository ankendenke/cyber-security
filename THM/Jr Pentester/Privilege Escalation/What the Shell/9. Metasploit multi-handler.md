Multi/Handler is a superb tool for catching reverse shells. It's essential if you want to use Meterpreter shells, and is the go-to when using staged payloads.

Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use:

1. Open Metasploit with `msfconsole`
2. Type `use multi/handler`, and press enter

We are now primed to start a multi/handler session. Let's take a look at the available options using the `options` command:

There are three options we need to set: payload, LHOST and LPORT. These are all identical to the options we set when generating  shellcode with Msfvenom -- a payload specific to our target, as well as a listening address and port with which we can receive a shell. Note that the LHOST _must_ be specified here, as metasploit will not listen on all network interfaces like netcat or socat will; it must be told a specific address to listen with (when using TryHackMe, this will be your [tun0 address](http://10.10.10.10/)). We set these options with the following commands:

- `set PAYLOAD <payload>`
- `set LHOST <listen-address>`
- `set LPORT <listen-port>`

We should now be ready to start the listener!

Let's do this by using the `exploit -j` command. This tells Metasploit to launch the module, running as a **j**ob in the background.

You may notice that in the above screenshot, Metasploit is listening on a port under 1024. To do this, Metasploit _must_ be run with sudo permissions.

When the staged payload generated in the previous task is run, Metasploit receives the connection, sending the remainder of the payload and giving us a reverse shell:

Notice that, because the multi/handler was originally backgrounded, we needed to use `sessions 1` to foreground it again. This worked as it was the only session running. Had there been other sessions active, we would have needed to use `sessions` to see all active sessions, then use `sessions <number>` to select the appropriate session to foreground. This number would also have been displayed in the line where the shell was opened (see "_Command Shell session **1** opened_").
