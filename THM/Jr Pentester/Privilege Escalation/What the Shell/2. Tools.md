There are a variety of tools that we will be using to receive reverse shells and to send bind shells. In general terms, we need malicious shell code, as well as a way of interfacing with the resulting shell. We will discuss each of these briefly below:

---

**Netcat:**

Netcat is the traditional "Swiss Army Knife" of networking. It is used to manually perform all kinds of network interactions, including things like banner grabbing during enumeration, but more importantly for our uses, it can be used to receive reverse shells and connect to remote ports attached to bind shells on a target system. Netcat shells are very unstable (easy to lose) by default, but can be improved by techniques that we will be covering in an upcoming task.  

**Socat:**

Socat is like netcat on steroids. It can do all of the same things, and _many_ more. Socat shells are usually more stable than netcat shells out of the box. In this sense it is vastly superior to netcat; however, there are two big catches:

1. The syntax is more difficult
2. Netcat is installed on virtually every Linux distribution by default. Socat is very rarely installed by default.

There are work arounds to both of these problems, which we will cover later on.

Both Socat and Netcat have .exe versions for use on Windows.  

**Metasploit -- multi/handler:**

The `exploit/multi/handler` module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells. Due to being part of the Metasploit framework, multi/handler provides a fully-fledged way to obtain stable shells, with a wide variety of further options to improve the caught shell. It's also the only way to interact with a _meterpreter_ shell, and is the easiest way to handle _staged_ payloads -- both of which we will look at in task 9.

**Msfvenom:**

Like multi/handler, msfvenom is technically part of the Metasploit Framework, however, it is shipped as a standalone tool. Msfvenom is used to generate payloads on the fly. Whilst msfvenom can generate payloads other than reverse and bind shells, these are what we will be focusing on in this room. Msfvenom is an incredibly powerful tool, so we will go into its application in much more detail in a dedicated task.

Aside from the tools we've already covered, there are some repositories of shells in many different languages. One of the most prominent of these is [Payloads all the Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md). The PentestMonkey [Reverse Shell Cheatsheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20200901140719/http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) is also commonly used. In addition to these online resources, Kali Linux also comes pre-installed with a variety of webshells located at `/usr/share/webshells`. The [SecLists repo](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), though primarily used for wordlists, also contains some very useful code for obtaining shells.
