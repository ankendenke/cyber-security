TCP connect scan works by completing the TCP 3-way handshake. In standard TCP connection establishment, the client sends a TCP packet with SYN flag set, and the server responds with SYN/ACK if the port is open; finally, the client completes the 3-way handshake by sending an ACK.

We are interested in learning whether the TCP port is open, not establishing a TCP connection. Hence the connection is torn as soon as its state is confirmed by sending a RST/ACK. You can choose to run TCP connect scan using `-sT`.

It is important to note that if you are not a privileged user (root or sudoer), a TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports.

In the following Wireshark packet capture window, we see Nmap sending TCP packets with SYN flag set to various ports, 256, 443, 143, and so on. By default, Nmap will attempt to connect to the 1000 most common ports. A closed TCP port responds to a SYN packet with RST/ACK to indicate that it is not open. This pattern will repeat for all the closed ports as we attempt to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake with them.

We notice that port 143 is open, so it replied with a SYN/ACK, and Nmap completed the 3-way handshake by sending an ACK. The figure below shows all the packets exchanged between our Nmap host and the target system’s port 143. The first three packets are the TCP 3-way handshake being completed. Then, the fourth packet tears it down with an RST/ACK packet.

To illustrate the `-sT` (TCP connect scan), the following command example returned a detailed list of the open ports.

Pentester Terminal

```shell-session
pentester@TryHackMe$ nmap -sT MACHINE_IP

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-30 09:53 BST
Nmap scan report for MACHINE_IP
Host is up (0.0024s latency).
Not shown: 995 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
25/tcp  open  smtp
80/tcp  open  http
111/tcp open  rpcbind
143/tcp open  imap
MAC Address: 02:45:BF:8A:2D:6B (Unknown)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.40 seconds
```

Note that we can use `-F` to enable fast mode and decrease the number of scanned ports from 1000 to 100 most common ports.

It is worth mentioning that the `-r` option can also be added to scan the ports in consecutive order instead of random order. This option is useful when testing whether ports open in a consistent manner, for instance, when a target boots up.
