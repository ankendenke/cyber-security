Unprivileged users are limited to connect scan. However, the default scan mode is SYN scan, and it requires a privileged (root or sudoer) user to run it. SYN scan does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, it tears down the connection once it receives a response from the server. Because we didn’t establish a TCP connection, this decreases the chances of the scan being logged. We can select this scan type by using the `-sS` option. The figure below shows how the TCP SYN scan works without completing the TCP 3-way handshake.

The following screenshot from Wireshark shows a TCP SYN scan. The behaviour in the case of closed TCP ports is similar to that of the TCP connect scan.

To better see the difference between the two scans, consider the following screenshot. In the upper half of the following figure, we can see a TCP connect scan `-sT` traffic. Any open TCP port will require Nmap to complete the TCP 3-way handshake before closing the connection. In the lower half of the following figure, we see how a SYN scan `-sS` does not need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake; instead, Nmap sends an RST packet once a SYN/ACK packet is received.

TCP SYN scan is the default scan mode when running Nmap as a privileged user, running as root or using sudo, and it is a very reliable choice. It has successfully discovered the open ports you found earlier with the TCP connect scan, yet no TCP connection was fully established with the target.
