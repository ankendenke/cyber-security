A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a victim (A) believes they are communicating with a legitimate destination (B) but is unknowingly communicating with an attacker (E). In the figure below, we have A requesting the transfer of $20 to M; however, E altered this message and replaced the original value with a new one. B received the modified messaged and acted on it.

This attack is relatively simple to carry out if the two parties do not confirm the authenticity and integrity of each message. In some cases, the chosen protocol does not provide secure authentication or integrity checking; moreover, some protocols have inherent insecurities that make them susceptible to this kind of attack.

Any time you browse over HTTP, you are susceptible to a MITM attack, and the scary thing is that you cannot recognize it. Many tools would aid you in carrying out such an attack, such as [Ettercap](https://www.ettercap-project.org/) and [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/).

MITM can also affect other cleartext protocols such as FTP, SMTP, and POP3. Mitigation against this attack requires the use of cryptography. The solution lies in proper authentication along with encryption or signing of the exchanged messages. With the help of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and trusted root certificates, Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects from MITM attacks.
