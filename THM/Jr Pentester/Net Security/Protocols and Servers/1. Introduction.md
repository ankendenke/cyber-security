This room introduces the user to a few protocols commonly used, such as:

- HTTP
- FTP
- POP3
- SMTP
- IMAP

Each task about each protocol will be designed to help us understand what happens on the low level and is usually hidden by an elegant GUI (Graphical User Interface). We will “talk” using the above protocols using a simple Telnet client to fully understand what your GUI client is doing under the hood. Our purpose is not to memorize the protocol commands but rather to get a closer look at the protocol while it is working.

We also discuss some of the insecurities. In particular, we focus on passwords sent in cleartext.
