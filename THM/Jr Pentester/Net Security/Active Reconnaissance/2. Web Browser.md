The web browser can be a convenient tool, especially that it is readily available on all systems. There are several ways where you can use a web browser to gather information about a target.

On the transport level, the browser connects to:

- TCP port 80 by default when the website is accessed over HTTP
- TCP port 443 by default when the website is accessed over HTTPS

Since 80 and 443 are default ports for HTTP and HTTPS, the web browser does not show them in the address bar. However, it is possible to use custom ports to access a service. For instance, https://127.0.0.1:8834/ will connect to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) at port 8834 via HTTPS protocol. If there is an HTTPS server listening on that port, we will receive a web page.

While browsing a web page, you can press `Ctrl+Shift+I` on a PC or `Option + Command + I` (`⌥ + ⌘ + I`) on a Mac to open the Developer Tools on Firefox. Similar shortcuts will also get you started with Google Chrome or Chromium. Developer Tools lets you inspect many things that your browser has received and exchanged with the remote server. For instance, you can view and even modify the JavaScript (JS) files, inspect the cookies set on your system and discover the folder structure of the site content.

Below is a screenshot of Firefox Developer Tools. Chrome DevTools is quite similar.

There are also plenty of add-ons for Firefox and Chrome that can help in penetration testing. Here are a few examples:

- **FoxyProxy** lets you quickly change the proxy server you are using to access the target website. This browser extension is convenient when you are using a tool such as Burp Suite or if you need to switch proxy servers regularly. You can get FoxyProxy for Firefox from [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard).
- **User-Agent Switcher and Manager** gives you the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different web browser. In other words, you can pretend to be browsing a site using an iPhone when in fact, you are accessing it from Mozilla Firefox. You can download User-Agent Switcher and Manager for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher).
- **Wappalyzer** provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites. Such extension is handy, primarily when you collect all this information while browsing the website like any other user. A screenshot of Wappalyzer is shown below. You can find Wappalyzer for Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer).
