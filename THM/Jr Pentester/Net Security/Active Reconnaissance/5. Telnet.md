The TELNET (Teletype Network) protocol was developed in 1969 to communicate with a remote system via a command-line interface (CLI). Hence, the command `telnet` uses the TELNET protocol for remote administration. The default port used by telnet is 23. From a security perspective, `telnet` sends all the data, including usernames and passwords, in cleartext. Sending in cleartext makes it easy for anyone, who has access to the communication channel, to steal the login credentials. The secure alternative is SSH (Secure SHell) protocol.

However, the telnet client, with its simplicity, can be used for other purposes. Knowing that telnet client relies on the TCP protocol, you can use Telnet to connect to any service and grab its banner. Using `telnet 10.10.6.54 PORT`, you can connect to any service running on TCP and even exchange a few messages unless it uses encryption.

Let’s say we want to discover more information about a web server, listening on port 80. We connect to the server at port 80, and then we communicate using the HTTP protocol. You don’t need to dive into the HTTP protocol; you just need to issue `GET / HTTP/1.1`. To specify something other than the default index page, you can issue `GET /page.html HTTP/1.1`, which will request `page.html`. We also specified to the remote web server that we want to use HTTP version 1.1 for communication. To get a valid response, instead of an error, you need to input some value for the host `host: example` and hit enter twice. Executing these steps will provide the requested index page.

Of particular interest for us is discovering the type and version of the installed web server, `Server: nginx/1.6.2`. In this example, we communicated with a web server, so we used basic HTTP commands. If we connect to a mail server, we need to use proper commands based on the protocol, such as SMTP and POP3.
