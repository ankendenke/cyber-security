Nmap can detect the Operating System (OS) based on its behaviour and any telltale signs in its responses. OS detection can be enabled using `-O`; this is an _uppercase O_ as in OS. In this example, we ran `nmap -sS -O 10.10.197.83` on the AttackBox. Nmap detected the OS to be Linux 3.X, and then it guessed further that it was running kernel 3.13.

The system that we scanned and attempted to detect its OS version is running kernel version 3.16. Nmap was able to make a close guess in this case. In another case, we scanned a Fedora Linux system with kernel 5.13.14; however, Nmap detected it as Linux 2.6.X. The good news is that Nmap detected the OS correctly; the not-so-good news is that the kernel version was wrong.

The OS detection is very convenient, but many factors might affect its accuracy. First and foremost, Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.

  

### Traceroute

If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add `--traceroute`. In the following example, Nmap appended a traceroute to its scan results. Note that Nmap’s traceroute works slightly different than the `traceroute` command found on Linux and macOS or `tracert` found on MS Windows. Standard `traceroute` starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it.

In the following example, we executed `nmap -sS --traceroute 10.10.197.83` on the AttackBox. We can see that there are no routers/hops between the two as they are connected directly.

```shell-session

It is worth mentioning that many routers are configured not to send ICMP Time-to-Live exceeded, which would prevent us from discovering their IP addresses. For more information, visit the [Active Reconnaissance](https://tryhackme.com/room/activerecon) room.
