In the first room of this series, we have learned how Nmap can enumerate targets, discover live hosts, and use reverse-DNS to find interesting names. The second and third rooms of the series focused on the basic and advanced types of scans for network ports.

In the last room, as shown in the figure below, we focus on how Nmap can be used to:

- Detect versions of the running services (on all open ports)
- Detect the OS based on any signs revealed by the target
- Run Nmap’s traceroute
- Run select Nmap scripts
- Save the scan results in various formats
