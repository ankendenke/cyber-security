In the previous task, we used the WHOIS protocol to get various information about the domain name we were looking up. In particular, we were able to get the DNS servers from the registrar.

Find the IP address of a domain name using `nslookup`, which stands for Name Server Look Up. You need to issue the command `nslookup DOMAIN_NAME`, for example, `nslookup tryhackme.com`. Or, more generally, you can use `nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER`. These three main parameters are:

- OPTIONS contains the query type as shown in the table below. For instance, you can use `A` for IPv4 addresses and `AAAA` for IPv6 addresses.
- DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.
- SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query. You can choose any local or public DNS server to query. Cloudflare offers `1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`, Google offers `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`, and Quad9 offers `9.9.9.9` and `149.112.112.112`. There are many [more public DNS servers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+dns) that you can choose from if you want alternatives to your ISP’s DNS servers.

|Query type|Result|
|---|---|
|A|IPv4 Addresses|
|AAAA|IPv6 Addresses|
|CNAME|Canonical Name|
|MX|Mail Servers|
|SOA|Start of Authority|
|TXT|TXT Records|

For instance, `nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1` (or `nslookup -type=a tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1` as it is case-insensitive) can be used to return all the IPv4 addresses used by tryhackme.com.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 1.1.1.1
Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	tryhackme.com
Address: 172.67.69.208
Name:	tryhackme.com
Address: 104.26.11.229
Name:	tryhackme.com
Address: 104.26.10.229
```

The A and AAAA records are used to return IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively. This lookup is helpful to know from a penetration testing perspective. In the example above, we started with one domain name, and we obtained three IPv4 addresses. Each of these IP addresses can be further checked for insecurities, assuming they lie within the scope of the penetration test.

Let’s say you want to learn about the email servers and configurations for a particular domain. You can issue `nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com`. Here is an example:

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 10 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 10 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.
tryhackme.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
```

We can see that tryhackme.com’s current email configuration uses Google. Since MX is looking up the Mail Exchange servers, we notice that when a mail server tries to deliver email `@tryhackme.com`, it will try to connect to the `aspmx.l.google.com`, which has order 1. If it is busy or unavailable, the mail server will attempt to connect to the next in order mail exchange servers, `alt1.aspmx.l.google.com` or `alt2.aspmx.l.google.com`.

Google provides the listed mail servers; therefore, we should not expect the mail servers to be running a vulnerable server version. However, in other cases, we might find mail servers that are not adequately secured or patched.

Such pieces of information might prove valuable as you continue the passive reconnaissance of your target. You can repeat similar queries for other domain names and try different types, such as `-type=txt`. Who knows what kind of information you might discover along your way!

For more advanced DNS queries and additional functionality, you can use `dig`, the acronym for “Domain Information Groper,” if you are curious. Let’s use `dig` to look up the MX records and compare them to `nslookup`. We can use `dig DOMAIN_NAME`, but to specify the record type, we would use `dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`. Optionally, we can select the server we want to query using `dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE`.

- SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query.
- DOMAIN_NAME is the domain name you are looking up.
- TYPE contains the DNS record type, as shown in the table provided earlier.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ dig tryhackme.com MX

; <<>> DiG 9.16.19-RH <<>> tryhackme.com MX
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<
        
```

A quick comparison between the output of `nslookup` and `dig` shows that `dig` returned more information, such as the TTL (Time To Live) by default. If you want to query a `1.1.1.1` DNS server, you can execute `dig @1.1.1.1 tryhackme.com MX`.

Using the AttackBox, open the terminal and use the `nslookup` or `dig` command to get the information you need to answer the following question.
