In this room, after we define passive reconnaissance and active reconnaissance, we focus on essential tools related to passive reconnaissance. We will learn three command-line tools:

- `whois` to query WHOIS servers
- `nslookup` to query DNS servers
- `dig` to query DNS servers

We use `whois` to query WHOIS records, while we use `nslookup` and `dig` to query DNS database records. These are all publicly available records and hence do not alert the target.

We will also learn the usage of two online services:

- DNSDumpster
- Shodan.io
