In [Nmap Basic Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02), we covered TCP flags and reviewed the TCP 3-way handshake. To initiate a connection, TCP requires the first packet to have the SYN flag set. Consequently, we can tell if a TCP port is open based on the response we receive.

Security researchers and hackers contemplated the TCP flags, shown in the figure below and explained in the previous room, and started to experiment. They wanted to know what would happen if we send a TCP packet, which is not part of any ongoing TCP connection, with one or more flags set.

For instance, an ACK flag is set when you want to acknowledge received data. An ACK scan is like trying to acknowledge data that was neither sent nor received in the first place. Consider this simple analogy, someone coming to you out of nowhere to tell you, “yes, I hear you, please continue.” when you haven’t said anything.

This room explains advanced types of scans and scan options. Some of these scan types can be useful against specific systems, while others are useful in particular network setups. We will cover the following types of port scans:

- Null Scan
- FIN Scan
- Xmas Scan
- Maimon Scan
- ACK Scan
- Window Scan
- Custom Scan

Moreover, we will cover the following:

- Spoofing IP
- Spoofing MAC
- Decoy Scan
- Fragmented Packets
- Idle/Zombie Scan

We will discuss options and techniques to evade firewalls and IDS systems. We also cover options to get more verbose details from Nmap.
