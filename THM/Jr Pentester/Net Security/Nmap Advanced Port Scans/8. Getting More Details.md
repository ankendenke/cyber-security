You might consider adding `--reason` if you want Nmap to provide more details regarding its reasoning and conclusions. Consider the two scans below to the system; however, the latter adds `--reason`.

Pentester Terminal

Providing the `--reason` flag gives us the explicit reason why Nmap concluded that the system is up or a particular port is open. In this console output above, we can see that this system is considered online because Nmap “received arp-response.” On the other hand, we know that the SSH port is deemed to be open because Nmap received a “syn-ack” packet back.

For more detailed output, you can consider using `-v` for verbose output or `-vv` for even more verbosity.

If `-vv` does not satisfy your curiosity, you can use `-d` for debugging details or `-dd` for even more details. You can guarantee that using `-d` will create an output that extends beyond a single screen.
