Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts. Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use `-n` to skip this step.

By default, Nmap will look up online hosts; however, you can use the option `-R` to query the DNS server even for offline hosts. If you want to use a specific DNS server, you can add the `--dns-servers DNS_SERVER` option.
