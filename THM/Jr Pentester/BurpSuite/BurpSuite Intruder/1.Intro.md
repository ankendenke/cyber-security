Burp Suite's Intruder module is a powerful tool that allows for automated and customisable attacks. It provides the ability to modify specific parts of a request and perform repetitive tests with variations of input data. Intruder is particularly useful for tasks like fuzzing and brute-forcing, where different values need to be tested against a target.
