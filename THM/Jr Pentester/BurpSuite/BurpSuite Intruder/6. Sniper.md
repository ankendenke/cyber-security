The **Sniper** attack type is the default and most commonly used attack type in Burp Suite Intruder. It is particularly effective for single-position attacks, such as password brute-force or fuzzing for API endpoints. In a Sniper attack, we provide a set of payloads, which can be a wordlist or a range of numbers, and Intruder inserts each payload into each defined position in the request.

Let's refer to our example template from before:

Example Positions

```html

username=§pentester§&password=§Expl01ted§
```

In this example, we have two positions defined for the `username` and `password` body parameters. In a Sniper attack, Intruder takes each payload from the payload set and substitutes it into each defined position in turn.

Assuming we have a wordlist with three words: `burp`, `suite`, and `intruder`, Intruder would generate six requests:

|Request Number|Request Body|
|---|---|
|1|`username=burp&password=Expl01ted`|
|2|`username=suite&password=Expl01ted`|
|3|`username=intruder&password=Expl01ted`|
|4|`username=pentester&password=burp`|
|5|`username=pentester&password=suite`|
|6|`username=pentester&password=intruder`|

Observe how Intruder starts with the first position (`username`) and substitutes each payload into it, then moves to the second position (`password`) and performs the same substitution with the payloads. The total number of requests made by Intruder Sniper can be calculated as `requests = numberOfWords * numberOfPositions`.

The Sniper attack type is beneficial when we want to perform tests with single-position attacks, utilizing different payloads for each position. It allows for precise testing and analysis of different payload variations.
