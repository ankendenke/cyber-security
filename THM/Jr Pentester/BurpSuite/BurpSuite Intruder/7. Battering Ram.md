The **Battering ram** attack type in Burp Suite Intruder differs from Sniper in that it places the same payload in every position simultaneously, rather than substituting each payload into each position in turn.

Let's refer back to our previous example template:

Example Positions

Using the Battering Ram attack type with the same wordlist from before (`burp`, `suite`, and `intruder`), Intruder would generate three requests:

|Request Number|Request Body|
|---|---|
|1|`username=burp&password=burp`|
|2|`username=suite&password=suite`|
|3|`username=intruder&password=intruder`|

As shown in the table, each payload from the wordlist is inserted into every position for each request made. In a Battering Ram attack, the same payload is thrown at every defined position simultaneously, providing a brute-force-like approach to testing.

The Battering Ram attack type is useful when we want to test the same payload against multiple positions at once without the need for sequential substitution.

In the upcoming tasks, we will explore further configurations and settings related to Intruder's Battering Ram attack type and examine its applications in different scenarios.
