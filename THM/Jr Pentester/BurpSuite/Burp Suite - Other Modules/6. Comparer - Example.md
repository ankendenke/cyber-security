We now know what Comparer does, but how is this useful?

There are many situations where being able to quickly compare two (potentially very large) pieces of data can come in handy.

For example, when performing a login bruteforce or credential stuffing attack with Intruder, you may wish to compare two responses with different lengths to see where the differences lie and whether the differences indicate a successful login.

#### Practical Example

1. Navigate to `http://MACHINE_IP/support/login`
    
    Try to log in with an invalid username and password – capture the request in the [Burp Proxy](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuitebasics).
    
2. Send the request to [Repeater](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater) with `Ctrl + R` (or Mac equivalent) or by right-clicking on the request in the Proxy module and choosing **Send to Repeater**.
    
3. Send the request, then right-click on the response and choose **Send to Comparer**.
