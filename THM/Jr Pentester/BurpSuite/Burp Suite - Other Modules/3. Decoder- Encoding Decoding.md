#### Encoding and Decoding with Decoder

Now, let's examine the manual encoding and decoding options in detail. These are identical whether the decoding or encoding menu is chosen:

- **Plain**: This refers to the raw text before any transformations are applied.
    
- **URL**: URL encoding is utilized to ensure the safe transfer of data in the URL of a web request. It involves substituting characters for their ASCII character code in hexadecimal format, preceded by a percentage symbol (%). This method is vital for any type of web application testing.
    
    For instance, encoding the forward-slash character (**/**), whose ASCII character code is 47, converts it to **2F** in hexadecimal, thus becoming **%2F** in URL encoding. The Decoder can be used to verify this by typing a forward slash in the input box, then selecting`Encode as -> URL` :

- **HTML**: HTML Entities encoding replaces special characters with an ampersand (&), followed by either a hexadecimal number or a reference to the character being escaped, and ending with a semicolon (;). This method ensures the safe rendering of special characters in HTML and helps prevent attacks such as XSS. The HTML option in Decoder allows any character to be encoded into its HTML escaped format or decode captured HTML entities. For instance, to decode a previously discussed quotation mark, input the encoded version and choose `Decode as -> HTML`:

- **Base64**: Base64, a commonly used encoding method, converts any data into an ASCII-compatible format. The under-the-hood functioning isn't crucial at this stage; however, interested individuals can find the underlying mathematics [here](https://stackabuse.com/encoding-and-decoding-base64-strings-in-python).
    
- **ASCII Hex**: This option transitions data between ASCII and hexadecimal representations. For instance, the word "ASCII" can be converted into the hexadecimal number "4153434949". Each character is converted from its numeric ASCII representation into hexadecimal.
    
- **Hex, Octal, and Binary**: These encoding methods apply solely to numeric inputs, converting between decimal, hexadecimal, octal (base eight), and binary representations.
    
- **Gzip**: Gzip compresses data, reducing file and page sizes before browser transmission. Faster load times are highly desirable for developers looking to enhance their SEO score and avoid user inconvenience. Decoder facilitates the manual encoding and decoding of gzip data, although it often isn't valid ASCII/Unicode. For instance:

These methods can be stacked. For example, a phrase ("Burp Suite Decoder") could be converted to ASCII Hex and then to octal:

In combination, these methods grant us substantial control over the data we are encoding or decoding.

Each encoding/decoding method is color-coded, enabling swift identification of the applied transformation.

##### Hex Format

While inputting data in ASCII format is beneficial, there are times when byte-by-byte input editing is necessary. This is where "Hex View" proves useful, selectable above the decoding options:

This feature enables us to view and alter our data in hexadecimal byte format, a vital tool when working with binary files or other non-ASCII data.

##### Smart Decode

Lastly, we have the **Smart decode** option. This feature tries to auto-decode encoded text. For instance, `&#x42;&#x75;&#x72;&#x70;&#x20;&#x53;&#x75;&#x69;&#x74;&#x65;` is automatically recognized as HTML encoded and is accordingly decoded:

While not perfect, this feature can be a quick solution for decoding unknown data chunks.
