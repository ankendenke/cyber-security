`Hash`In addition to its Encoding/Decoding functionality, Decoder also offers the ability to generate hashsums for our data.

#### Theory

Hashing is a one-way process that transforms data into a unique signature. For a function to qualify as a hashing algorithm, the output it generates must be irreversible. A proficient hashing algorithm ensures that every data input will generate a completely unique hash. For instance, using the MD5 algorithm to produce a hashsum for the text "MD5sum" returns `4ae1a02de5bd02a5515f583f4fca5e8c`. Using the same algorithm for "MD5SUM" yields an entirely different hash despite the close resemblance of the input: `13b436b09172400c9eb2f69fbd20adad`. Therefore, hashes are commonly used to verify the integrity of files and documents, as even a tiny alteration to the file significantly changes the hashsum.

**Note:** The MD5 algorithm is deprecated and should not be used for contemporary applications.

Moreover, hashes are used to securely store passwords since the one-way hashing process makes the passwords relatively secure, even if the database is compromised. When a user creates a password, the application hashes and stores it. During login, the application hashes the submitted password and compares it against the stored hash; if they match, the password is correct. Using this method, an application never needs to store the original (plaintext) password.

#### Hashing in Decoder

Decoder allows us to create hashsums for data directly within Burp Suite; it operates similarly to the encoding/decoding options we discussed earlier. Specifically, we click on the **Hash** dropdown menu and select an algorithm from the list:

**Note:** This list is significantly longer than the encoding/decoding algorithms – it's worth scrolling through to see the many available hashing algorithms.

Continuing with our earlier example, let's enter "MD5sum" into the input box, then scroll down the list until we find "MD5". Applying this automatically takes us into the Hex view:

A hashing algorithm's output does not yield pure ASCII/Unicode text. Hence, it's customary to convert the algorithm's output into a hexadecimal string; this is the "hash" form you might be familiar with.

Let's complete this by applying an "ASCII Hex" encoding to the hashsum to create the neat hex string from our initial example.

Here's the full process:
