Welcome to a world where launching web attacks is so easy that even beginners (like script kiddies) can write simple scripts to hack into big businesses. These attacks are like sneaky tricks that can cause much trouble online. In this room, we will focus on one such web attack called **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF)**. We will understand various exploitation techniques of CSRF and protection measures for its prevention.  

Learning Objectives

- Understanding the working of CSRF
- Type of CSRF attacks
