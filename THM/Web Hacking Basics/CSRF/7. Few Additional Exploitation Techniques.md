XMLHttpRequest Exploitation

In the context of an AJAX request, CSRF is like someone making your web browser unknowingly send a request to a website where you're logged in. It's as if someone tricked your browser into doing something on a trusted site without your awareness, potentially causing unintended actions or changes in your account. CSRF attacks can still succeed even when AJAX requests are subject to the [Same-Origin Policy (SOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy), which typically forbids cross-origin requests.

Here's an example of how an attacker can update a password on `mybank.thm` and send an asynchronous request to update the email seamlessly.

```javascript
<script>
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open('POST', 'http://mybank.thm/updatepassword', true);
        xhr.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest");
        xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
        xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
            if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status === 200) {
                alert("Action executed!");
            }
        };
        xhr.send('action=execute&parameter=value');
    </script>
```

The XMLHttpRequest in the above code is designed to submit form data to the server and include custom headers. The complete process of sending requests will be seamless as the requests are performed in Javascript using AJAX.   

Same Origin Policy (SOP) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Bypass

[CORS and SOP](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/corsandsop) bypass to launch CSRF is like an attacker using a trick to make your web browser send requests to a different website than the one you're on. Under an appropriate CORS policy, certain requests could only be submitted by recognised origins. However, misconfigurations in CORS policies can allow attackers to circumvent these limitations if they rely on origins that the attacker can control or if credentials are included in cross-origin requests. 

```php
<?php // Server-side code (PHP)
 header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); 
// Allow requests from any origin (vulnerable CORS configuration) .
..// code to update email address ?>
```

﻿This is a simple PHP server-side script that handles the POST request. It has a vulnerable CORS configuration (**Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ***), allowing requests from any origin, and thus is vulnerable to CSRF since it doesn't implement anti-CSRF measures. The usage of **Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *** depends on the specific business use case and requirements. There are scenarios where allowing requests from different origins is necessary and legitimate, such as in public APIs or content distribution networks. However, it's crucial to carefully consider the security implications and ensure that **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials** is set accordingly to forward credentials only to trusted origins. It's important to note that **Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *** and **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:true** cannot be used together due to security restrictions imposed by the [CORS specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol-and-credentials). You will learn various CORS bypass techniques in a separate room on THM.  

Referer Header Bypass

When making an HTTP request, the referer header contains the URL of the last page the user visited before making the current request. Some websites guard against CSRF by only allowing queries if the referer header matches their domain. The utility of this as a stand-alone CSRF protection solution is reduced when this header may be changed or eliminated, as happens with user-installed browser extensions, privacy tools, or meta tags that instruct the browser to omit the Referer.  

Now that we have an understanding of various exploitation techniques of CSRF. We will now discuss key mitigation measures to protect from the attack.
