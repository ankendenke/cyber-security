Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, also known as CORS, is a mechanism that allows web applications to request resources from different domains securely. This is crucial in web security as it prevents malicious scripts on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through the browser.

Same-origin policy, also known as SOP, is a security measure restricting web pages from interacting with resources from different origins. An origin is defined by the scheme (protocol), hostname (domain), and URL port.
