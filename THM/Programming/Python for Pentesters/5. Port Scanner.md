In this task, we will be looking at a script to build a simple port scanner.  
  
The code:

```python
 
import sys
import socket
import pyfiglet


ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
print(ascii_banner)


ip = '192.168.1.6' 
open_ports =[] 

ports = range(1, 65535)


def probe_port(ip, port, result = 1): 
  try: 
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
    sock.settimeout(0.5) 
    r = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))   
    if r == 0: 
      result = r 
    sock.close() 
  except Exception as e: 
    pass 
  return result


for port in ports: 
    sys.stdout.flush() 
    response = probe_port(ip, port) 
    if response == 0: 
        open_ports.append(port) 
    

if open_ports: 
  print ("Open Ports are: ") 
  print (sorted(open_ports)) 
else: 
  print ("Looks like no ports are open :(")



```

To better understand the port scanning process, we can break down the code into several sections:   
  
**Importing modules that will help the code run:**

```python
import sys
```

```python
import socket
```

**Modules could also be imported with a single line using**

```python
import socket,sys
```

**  
**Specifying the target:****

```python
ip = '192.168.1.6' 
```

**  
**An empty “open_ports” array that will be populated later with the detected open ports:**  
**

```python
open_ports =[] 
```

**  
**Ports that will be probed:****

```python

ports = range(1, 65535)
```

For this example, we have chosen to scan all TCP ports using the range() function. However, if you are looking for a specific service or want to save time by scanning a few common ports, the code could be changed as follows;

```python
ports = { 21, 22, 23, 53, 80, 135, 443, 445}
```

The list above is relatively small. As we are trying to keep a rather low profile, we have limited the list to ports that will likely be used by systems connected to a corporate network.Getting the IP address of the domain name given as target. The code also works if the user directly provides the IP address.

```python
ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)
```

Tries to connect to the port:

This code is followed by a for loop that iterates through the specified port list:

Of course, I will be the first one to admit the ASCII art banner was a bit much. The banner will require Pyfiglet to be imported. If you are using the AttackBox, you can easily install pyfiglet using the "apt install python3-pyfiglet" command.

If you wish to remove the banner you can simply delete the following lines:

```python
ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
```

```python
print(ascii_banner)
```
