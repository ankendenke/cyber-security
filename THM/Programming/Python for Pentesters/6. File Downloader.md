Wget on Linux systems or Certutil on Windows are useful tools to download files.

Python can also be used for the same purpose.  
  
The code:

```python
 
import requests

url = 'https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/THMlogo.png'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('THMlogo.png', 'wb').write(r.content)

```

This short piece of code can easily be adapted to retrieve any other type of file, as seen below:

```python
 
import requests

url = 'https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('PSTools.zip', 'wb').write(r.content)  

```

﻿﻿PSexec allow system administrators to run commands on remote Windows systems. We see that PSexec is also used in cyber attacks as it is usually not detected by antivirus software. You can learn more about PSexec [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) and read [this](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/threat-hunting-how-to-detect-psexec/) blogpost about its use by attackers.
