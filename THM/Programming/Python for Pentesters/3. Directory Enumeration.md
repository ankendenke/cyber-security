As it is often pointed out, reconnaissance is one of the most critical steps to the success of a penetration testing engagement. Once subdomains have been discovered, the next step would be to find directories.

The following code will build a simple directory enumeration tool.

```python

import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("wordlist.txt").read() 
directories = sub_list.splitlines()

for dir in directories:
    dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html" 
    r = requests.get(dir_enum)
    if r.status_code==404: 
        pass
    else:
        print("Valid directory:" ,dir_enum)

```

At first glance, you will certainly notice the similarities with the subdomain enumeration script. This script takes an approach based on a for loop and passes all "404" responses.
