Imagine living in a heavily insecure street with many expensive things in your home. You must be thinking of having a security guard and a few CCTV cameras in your home. Hiding the expensive material inside a hidden underground room is a good idea if any intruder successfully enters the house. These are the things that you plan for the safety of your home, even before any attack occurs.

Besides these proactive measures, did you ever consider how things would work if someone successfully bypassed your external security mechanisms and gained access to your home? You must also take several other measures after your home is attacked.

Let’s take the above into the Digital Realm. You may have heard about a cyber attack on any organization that caused them to lose thousands of dollars. Several such cases are reported daily on the internet. These are referred to as **Cyber Security Incidents**. Just as in the scenario above, where you planned for the security of your home, cyber security incidents also need some planning and resources to avoid huge losses.

Incident Response handles an incident from its start to end. From deploying security in several areas to prevent incidents to fighting with them, and minimizing their impact, incident response is a thorough guideline.
