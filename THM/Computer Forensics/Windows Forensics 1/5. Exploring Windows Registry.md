Once we have extracted the registry hives, we need a tool to view these files as we would in the registry editor. Since the registry editor only works with live systems and can't load exported hives, we can use the following tools:  

**Registry Viewer:**

As we can see in the screenshot below, [AccessData's Registry Viewer](https://accessdata.com/product-download/registry-viewer-2-0-0) has a similar user interface to the Windows Registry Editor. There are a couple of limitations, though. It only loads one hive at a time, and it can't take the transaction logs into account.

**Zimmerman's Registry Explorer:**

Eric Zimmerman has developed a handful of [tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md) that are very useful for performing Digital Forensics and Incident Response. One of them is the Registry Explorer. It looks like the below screenshot. It can load multiple hives simultaneously and add data from transaction logs into the hive to make a more 'cleaner' hive with more up-to-date data. It also has a handy 'Bookmarks' option containing forensically important registry keys often sought by forensics investigators. Investigators can go straight to the interesting registry keys and values with the bookmarks menu item. We will explore these in more detail in the upcoming tasks.

 **RegRipper:**

[RegRipper](https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0) is a utility that takes a registry hive as input and outputs a report that extracts data from some of the forensically important keys and values in that hive. The output report is in a text file and shows all the results in sequential order. 

RegRipper is available in both a CLI and GUI form which is shown in the screenshot below.

One shortcoming of RegRipper is that it does not take the transaction logs into account. We must use Registry Explorer to merge transaction logs with the respective registry hives before sending the output to RegRipper for a more accurate result.

Even though we have discussed these different tools, for the purpose of this room, we will only be using Registry Explorer and some of Eric Zimmerman's tools. The other tools mentioned here will be covered in separate rooms.
