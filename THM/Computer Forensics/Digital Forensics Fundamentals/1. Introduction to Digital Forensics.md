Forensics is the application of methods and procedures to investigate and solve crimes. The branch of forensics that investigates cyber crimes is known as **digital forensics**. **Cyber crime** is any criminal activity conducted on or using a digital device. Several tools and techniques are used to investigate digital devices thoroughly after any crime to find and analyze evidence for necessary legal action.

Digital devices have solved many of our problems. Communication all around the globe is just a matter of a text or call. Due to the vast usage of digital devices, besides making life easier, an increase in digital crimes - cyber crimes has also been observed. A variety of crimes are committed using digital devices.

Consider an example where law enforcement agencies raid a bank robber’s place with proper search warrants. Some digital devices, including a laptop, mobile phone, hard drive, and a USB, were found in the robber’s home. The law enforcement agency handed over the case to the digital forensics team. The team collected evidence securely and conducted a thorough investigation inside their digital forensics lab equipped with forensics tools. The following evidence was found on the digital devices:

- A digital map of the bank was found on the suspect’s laptop, which they kept for planning the robbery.
- A document with the bank’s entrance and escape routes was found on the suspect’s hard drive.
- A document on the hard drive that listed all the bank’s physical security controls. The suspect devised plans to bypass the security measures.
- Some media files, including photos and videos of the suspect’s previous robberies, were inside the suspect’s laptop.
- After conducting a thorough investigation of the suspect’s mobile phone, some illegal chat groups and call records related to the bank robbery were also found.

All this evidence helped law enforcement in the legal proceedings of the case. This scenario discusses a case from the start till the end. Some procedures are followed by the digital forensics team while collecting the evidence, storing it, analyzing it, and reporting it. This room will focus on covering the understanding of these procedures. The following are the learning objectives of this room:
