In Digital Forensics, imaging is the process of creating an exact, bit-by-bit copy of digital storage media. This process ensures that all the data, including deleted files, hidden files, and unallocated space, is captured. By generating a forensic image, we preserve the original data, allowing for a thorough examination.

The primary goal of this process is to create a verifiable and reliable copy that can be used in investigations and legal proceedings. This process is crucial for maintaining the integrity of digital evidence, ensuring that the original data remains untouched and admissible in legal matters. 

Furthermore, the process plays a critical role in maintaining the [chain of custody](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/dfirprocesslegalconsiderations), a crucial aspect of legal proceedings. By documenting the handling and transfer of digital evidence, we can demonstrate that the data has been preserved correctly and has not been tampered with, providing a reliable and transparent method for examining it.
