Now that we have identified the device, we want to create an image. Let's go ahead and copy this disk to a `raw` image file for further inspection. This could also be done to another disk if needed, which is a common practice, but in this case, we will do it to a local file in our system with the `.img` extension to identify the file as an image.

As we recall from our previous task, there is a great variety of tools we can use to create images. We will use `dc3dd` in this example, an enhanced version of the UNIX command `dd`. Below, you can find a list of some common tools used to create images.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|`dd`|A standard Unix utility for copying and converting files, often used for creating raw disk images|
|`dc3dd`|An enhanced version of `dd` with additional features for forensic imaging, including hashing and logging|
|`ddrescue`|A data recovery tool that efficiently copies data from damaged drives, attempting to rescue as much data as possible|
|`FTK Imager`|A GUI-based tool for creating forensic images, widely used for its ease of use and comprehensive features|
|`Guymager`|A GUI-based forensic imaging tool that supports various image formats and provides detailed logs|
|`EWF tools (ewfacquire)`|Tools for creating and handling Expert Witness Format (EWF) images, often used in digital forensics|

Imaging

To start, let's execute the `dc3dd`  command with the following parameters:

- The `if` option (input file), indicates the device we want to copy; in this case, `/dev/loop10`
- The `of` option (output file) indicates where we want to write the disk bytes, in this case, a file named `example1.img`
- The `log` options will save all the output into a file. In our example, `imaging_loop10.txt`  
    

Below, we can observe the command output of `dc3dd` using the parameters mentioned.

```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ sudo dc3dd if=/dev/loop10 of=example1.img log=imaging_loop10.txt

dc3dd 7.2.646 started at 2024-06-28 22:58:59 +0000
compiled options:
command line: dc3dd if=/dev/loop10 of=example1.img log=imaging_loop10.txt
device size: 2252800 sectors (probed),    1,153,433,600 bytes
sector size: 512 bytes (probed)
  1153433600 bytes ( 1.1 G ) copied ( 100% ),   13 s, 84 M/s                  

input results for device `/dev/loop10':
   2252800 sectors in
   0 bad sectors replaced by zeros

output results for file `example1.img':
   2252800 sectors out

dc3dd completed at 2024-06-28 22:59:12 +0000
```

From the output above, we can confirm that the operation seemed to be successful and that we created a file of the same size, as shown below.

Forensic Imaging

```shell-session
user@tryhackme$ ls -alh example1.img 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.1G Jun 28 22:28 example1.img
```

Now, let's check what other activities we can perform in the next rooms after the imaging process is over.
