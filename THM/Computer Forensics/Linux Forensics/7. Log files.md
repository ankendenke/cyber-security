One of the most important sources of information on the activity on a Linux host is the log files. These log files maintain a history of activity performed on the host and the amount of logging depends on the logging level defined on the system. Let's take a look at some of the important log sources. Logs are generally found in the `/var/log` directory.

## Syslog

The Syslog contains messages that are recorded by the host about system activity. The detail which is recorded in these messages is configurable through the logging level. We can use the `cat` utility to view the Syslog, which can be found in the file `/var/log/syslog`. Since the Syslog is a huge file, it is easier to use `tail`, `head`, `more` or `less` utilities to help make it more readable.

Syslog

```shell-session
user@machine$ cat /var/log/syslog* | head
Mar 29 00:00:37 tryhackme systemd-resolved[519]: Server returned error NXDOMAIN, mitigating potential DNS violation DVE-2018-0001, retrying transaction with reduced feature level UDP.

Mar 29 00:09:01 tryhackme CRON[7713]: (root) CMD (   test -x /etc/cron.daily/popularity-contest && /etc/cron.daily/popularity-contest --crond)
Mar 29 00:17:01 tryhackme CRON[7726]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)
Mar 29 00:30:45 tryhackme snapd[2930]: storehelpers.go:721: cannot refresh: snap has no updates available: "amazon-ssm-agent", "core", "core18", "core20", "lxd"

Mar 29 01:50:37 tryhackme systemd[1]: Starting Cleanup of Temporary Directories...
```

The above terminal shows the system time, system name, the process that sent the log [the process id], and the details of the log. We can see a couple of cron jobs being run here in the logs above, apart from some other activity. We can see an asterisk(*) after the syslog. This is to include rotated logs as well. With the passage of time, the Linux machine rotates older logs into files such as syslog.1, syslog.2 etc, so that the syslog file doesn't become too big. In order to search through all of the syslogs, we use the asterisk(*) wildcard.

## Auth logs

We have already discussed the auth logs in the previous tasks. The auth logs contain information about users and authentication-related logs. The below terminal shows a sample of the auth logs.

Auth logs

```shell-session
user@machine$ cat /var/log/auth.log* |head
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: new group: name=ubuntu, GID=1000
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: new user: name=ubuntu, UID=1000, GID=1000, home=/home/ubuntu, shell=/bin/bash, from=none
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'adm'
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'dialout'
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'cdrom'
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'floppy'
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'sudo'
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'audio'
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'dip'
Feb 27 13:52:33 ip-10-10-238-44 useradd[392]: add 'ubuntu' to group 'video'
```

We can see above that the log stored information about the creation of a new group, a new user, and the addition of the user into different groups.

### Third-party logs

Similar to the syslog and authentication logs, the `/var/log/` directory contains logs for third-party applications such as webserver, database, or file share server logs. We can investigate these by looking at the `/var/log/` directory.

Third-party logs

```shell-session
user@machine$ ls /var/log
Xorg.0.log          apt                    cloud-init.log  dmesg.2.gz      gdm3                    kern.log.1         prime-supported.log  syslog.2.gz
Xorg.0.log.old      auth.log               cups            dmesg.3.gz      gpu-manager-switch.log  landscape          private              syslog.3.gz
alternatives.log    auth.log.1             dist-upgrade    dmesg.4.gz      gpu-manager.log         lastlog            samba                syslog.4.gz
alternatives.log.1  btmp                   dmesg           dpkg.log        hp                      lightdm            speech-dispatcher    syslog.5.gz
amazon              btmp.1                 dmesg.0         dpkg.log.1      journal                 openvpn            syslog               unattended-upgrades
apache2             cloud-init-output.log  dmesg.1.gz      fontconfig.log  kern.log                prime-offload.log  syslog.1             wtmp
```

As is obvious, we can find the apache logs in the apache2 directory and samba logs in the samba directory.

Apachelogs

```shell-session
user@machine$  ls /var/log/apache2/
access.log  error.log  other_vhosts_access.log
```

Similarly, if any database server like MySQL is installed on the system, we can find the logs in this directory.
