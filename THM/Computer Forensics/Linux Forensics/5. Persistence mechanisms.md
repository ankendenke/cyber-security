Knowing the environment we are investigating, we can then move on to finding out what persistence mechanisms exist on the Linux host under investigation. Persistence mechanisms are ways a program can survive after a system reboot. This helps malware authors retain their access to a system even if the system is rebooted. Let's see how we can identify persistence mechanisms in a Linux host.

## Cron jobs

Cron jobs are commands that run periodically after a set amount of time. A Linux host maintains a list of Cron jobs in a file located at `/etc/crontab`. We can read the file using the `cat` utility.

Cron jobs

```shell-session
user@machine$ cat /etc/crontab 
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
17 *	* * *	root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6	* * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6	* * 7	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6	1 * *	root	test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
#
```

The above terminal output shows the contents of a sample `/etc/crontab` file. As can be seen, the file contains information about the time interval after which the command has to run, the username that runs the command, and the command itself. It can also contain scripts to run, where the script that needs to be run will be placed on the disk, and the command to run it will be added to this file.

## Service startup

Like Windows, services can be set up in Linux that will start and run in the background after every system boot. A list of services can be found in the `/etc/init.d` directory. We can check the contents of the directory by using the `ls` utility.

Service startup

```shell-session
user@machine$ ls /etc/init.d/
acpid       avahi-daemon      cups          hibagent           kmod             networking     pppd-dns                     screen-cleanup     unattended-upgrades
alsa-utils  bluetooth         cups-browsed  hwclock.sh         lightdm          open-iscsi     procps                       speech-dispatcher  uuidd
anacron     console-setup.sh  dbus          irqbalance         lvm2             open-vm-tools  pulseaudio-enable-autospawn  spice-vdagent      whoopsie
apparmor    cron              gdm3          iscsid             lvm2-lvmpolld    openvpn        rsync                        ssh                x11-common
apport      cryptdisks        grub-common   kerneloops         multipath-tools  plymouth       rsyslog                      udev
atd         cryptdisks-early  hddtemp       keyboard-setup.sh  network-manager  plymouth-log   saned                        ufw
```

## .Bashrc

When a bash shell is spawned, it runs the commands stored in the `.bashrc` file. This file can be considered as a startup list of actions to be performed. Hence it can prove to be a good place to look for persistence. 

The following terminal shows an example .bashrc file.

Bashrc

```shell-session
user@machine$ cat ~/.bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

# If not running interactively, don't do anything
case $- in
    *i*) ;;
      *) return;;
esac

# set variable identifying the chroot you work in (used in the prompt below)
if [ -z "${debian_chroot:-}" ] && [ -r /etc/debian_chroot ]; then
    debian_chroot=$(cat /etc/debian_chroot)
fi

# set a fancy prompt (non-color, unless we know we "want" color)
case "$TERM" in
    xterm-color|*-256color) color_prompt=yes;;
esac

# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
case "$TERM" in
xterm*|rxvt*)
    PS1="\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h: \w\a\]$PS1"
    ;;
*)
    ;;
esac

# Add an "alert" alias for long running commands.  Use like so:
#   sleep 10; alert
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'

# Alias definitions.
# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi

# enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable
# this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile
# sources /etc/bash.bashrc).
if ! shopt -oq posix; then
  if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
fi
```

System-wide settings are stored in `/etc/bash.bashrc` and `/etc/profile` files, so it is often a good idea to take a look at these files as well.
