We learned about Windows Forensics in the [previous room](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsforensics1) and practiced extracting forensic artifacts from the Windows Registry. We learned about gathering system information, user information, files and folders accessed, programs run, and external devices connected to the system, all from the Windows registry.

However, the registry is not the only place where forensic artifacts are present. In this room, we will learn about forensic artifacts in other places. We will learn about the different file systems commonly used by Windows and where to look in these file systems when looking for artifacts. We will identify locations and artifacts to prove evidence of execution, file/folder usage or knowledge, and external device usage. We will also cover the basics of recovering deleted files. We will use [Eric Zimmerman's tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md) to parse information present in the artifacts for most of this room. We already used Registry Explorer and ShellBags Explorer in the previous room. For some of the tasks, we will use Autopsy.
