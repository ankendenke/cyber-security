Evidence-based Approach

A digital forensics practitioner must refrain from hastily making conclusions and judgment calls. For instance, viewing a **person of interest** from a judgemental lens of suspicion may be construed as personal bias, which should not be allowed to cloud the results of an investigation.

Using evidence properly is critical to ensuring investigations are thorough and follow the law. Focusing on what the evidence shows makes it hard to argue against facts and enables an investigation to yield conclusive results that strictly adhere to legal requirements. Additionally, this approach is **repeatable**, meaning that others following the same methods should arrive at similar, if not the same, conclusions, further strengthening the investigation's integrity.

Burden of Proof in Digital Forensics

Investigators need to provide sufficient and credible evidence to support their findings. This principle ensures that conclusions are not based on assumptions or incomplete information.

The burden of proof demands adherence to a high standard of evidence, ensuring that the conclusions drawn are not only supported by the evidence but are also legally defensible. It serves as a reminder that the investigator is responsible for building a case that withstands scrutiny, adhering to legal standards and ethical guidelines throughout the investigative process.

Ethical Decision-Making in Digital Investigations

Legal Compliance in Digital Forensics

Legal compliance is a fundamental aspect of digital forensics. A multitude of legal frameworks and privacy laws govern digital investigations, including the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)**, devised to combat fraudulent accounting and financial practices that have substantial implications for security and data retention, and the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA)**, which outlines illegal digital activity.

For instance, the [SOX](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763) Act, post-[Enron scandal](https://www.justice.gov/archive/enron/), significantly impacts how corporate data is managed and audited, presenting a complex landscape for investigators. Similarly, the [CFAA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/4718), often debated for its broad interpretations, has led to notable cases like [United States v. Lori Drew](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/11-17-2009-us-v-lori-drew.pdf), highlighting the intricate interplay between ethical discernment and legal mandates in digital investigations.

These case studies and laws also show the necessity of an evidence-based approach, where every action and decision in a digital investigation is grounded in legality and ethical integrity. It's not just about finding the truth but doing so in a manner that respects individual rights and adheres to the legal framework, thus ensuring that the outcomes of investigations are both valid and defensible in a Court of Law.

It is crucial to differentiate DFIR work from a security or maturity assessment that evaluates compliance with frameworks like PCI-DSS. Our objective is not to pinpoint vulnerabilities. Our focus in DFIR is akin to piecing a puzzle together, where evidence is gathered and collected by acquiring and analyzing artefacts to uncover the truth.

Consider a case where a financial institution faces unauthorized data access. Our task as DFIR professionals is like puzzle-solving: we methodically gather and analyze pieces of digital evidence - tracing digital footprints, reviewing access logs, and recovering deleted files.

This process is not about assessing implementation compliance with standards like PCI-DSS but following a systematic, evidence-based approach. We aim to see and construct a clear picture of the incident from a broader perspective, ensuring our findings are factual, based on solid evidence, and can be replicated to reach the same conclusions.

Understanding Authority in Digital Investigations

People have different views on ethics and law, but those in charge, like judges and district attorneys, make the final decisions when it comes to legal matters. It shows the importance of recognizing and respecting the people who have the power to enforce and interpret the law.

Laws like the SOX Act and CFAA can be interpreted differently in different places or by other judges. But in the end, judges, lawmakers, and law enforcement officials have the final word. Recognizing authority means understanding who is in charge and accepting that they have the final say, even if you might have your own opinions.

As an incident responder, it's also crucial for those under investigation to recognize your authority. Your role is to follow the legal system's structure and ensure investigations meet the higher legal and ethical standards. Staying up-to-date with how laws are interpreted and changing is part of this. Balancing personal ethics, professional behavior, and following legal rules is critical to doing good work in digital investigations.
