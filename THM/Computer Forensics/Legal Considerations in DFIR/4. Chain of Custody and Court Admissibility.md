Rules of Evidence in Various Jurisdictions

The Rules of Evidence are foundational principles that govern the admissibility, relevance, and quality of evidence in legal proceedings across various jurisdictions. While specific rules vary per country or jurisdiction, core concepts are universally recognized worldwide in courtrooms.

Key among these is the principle of relevance, ensuring that all evidence presented is directly related to the case at hand. Additionally, evidence must be reliable and believable, which requires checking and confirming its authenticity.

These rules serve the dual purpose of safeguarding the legal process and ensuring fair proceedings. Authorities in legal and investigative fields, including judges and attorneys, are responsible for upholding these rules and applying them judiciously to ensure justice while honoring the rights of every individual involved.

Chain of Custody and Handling Digital Evidence

Often, court rules typically do not allow hearsay or indirect information, except in exceptional cases. Hence, keeping evidence safe from tampering or damage is essential.

The Chain of Custody records who handled the evidence and how it was protected, from when it was collected until it was presented in court, ensuring the evidence is genuine and unchanged. The general process is as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|- **Document everything properly**<br>    - Record all seized items (like devices or files) as evidence.<br>    - Note the exact date and time of the seizure.<br>    - Identify who collected the evidence.<br>    - Detail the situation and steps followed during the seizure.<br>- **Prevent any changes to the Evidence**<br>    - **For digital files:**<br>        - Generally, a witness needs to vouch for the authenticity of digital files. However, business records (like server logs) can be exceptions if created due to normal business activities and if the person presenting them as evidence knows them well.<br>        - It is crucial to show these records have remained unaltered from acquisition to court proceedings.<br>    - **For physical devices:**<br>        - If it's a device, unplug it instead of shutting it down normally to avoid unwanted data alterations.<br>        - Make a forensic disk image of the device's storage for analysis using accepted tools and write blockers to prevent altering the original data.<br>- **Securely hash and copy files** to keep the original data safe and unchanged. **Only a copy** of the file or disk must be used for analysis. The original, which will be shown in court, should be kept safe. When taking the hash of the original, ensure that the hash of the copy matches it before and during court proceedings to prove the data hasn't been changed.<br>- **Package and label evidence securely** before it is handled by the legal team presenting it in court.|![Chain of Custody & Admissible Evidence](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/9904fdf53956622d97e2267547c6afa5.svg)|

Court Admissibility of Evidence

For digital evidence to be admissible in court, it must be relevant, reliable, and obtained legally. The Chain of Custody plays a pivotal role in demonstrating these aspects by providing a transparent and traceable link from the evidence to the matter at hand. Proper procedures and adherence to established forensic standards are paramount in maintaining the integrity and admissibility of the evidence.

Adhering to these guidelines and procedures ensures digital evidence is handled with the utmost care and professionalism, maintaining its integrity and standing in legal contexts. As a result, it supports the pursuit of justice, ensuring that the truth is accurately represented and upheld in legal proceedings.
