Incident Scenario

The Chief Finance Officer (CFO) received an email receipt for an unauthorized transaction of **over $9,000.00**. Despite the billing information implicating the CFO and their Executive Assistant (EA), they both vehemently deny making the purchase. The CFO promptly alerted the Human Resources (HR) and Security Operations (SecOps) team to investigate the matter. As a member of the SecOps team, you and your team were tasked to investigate the matter and identify whether a security breach had occurred.

**IMPORTANT: The questions have been tailored to focus only on relevant artefacts to the incident. We will apply the concepts covered within each task concerning the incident as we walk through it from the lens of an incident responder.**

Incident Detection and Initial Response

Incident detection doesn't depend just on purely technical controls but also on the active involvement and contribution of the individuals affected. For incident responders to recognize, acknowledge, and declare an incident, whether related to security or operations, they must remain calm, understand the situation, and consider these varied sources of information.

The initial response to an incident can be shaped by various factors, including the incident's nature, available information, and the incident responder's experience. In our example above, the response typically involves piecing together indirect evidence and leveraging different investigative techniques and tools to address the incident comprehensively.

Importance of Documentation

Proper documentation is critical in detailing **_what happened_** during an incident. Key points to document include:

- Details on the person (or persons) of interest (POI), someone being investigated or questioned, and their involvement in the incident.
- The specific actions that led to the incident, such as entering sensitive information into a suspected phishing site.
- Nature and extent of the data compromised or lost.
- Any direct or indirect evidence that will help shed light on the incident.

In our example scenario, even if the browsing history of a given machine was not present, it does not negate the machine's interaction with the phishing site or the occurrence of the phishing itself. Acknowledging the principle that **Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence** may help show the need to look at other sources of information. Other indicators, like network logs or unusual account activity, may still reveal the incident's traces, highlighting the importance of investigating beyond apparent sources.

Pinpointing **_when it happened_** is just as crucial. Important timestamps to record are:

- The exact time and date the incident was detected and believed to have occurred. This should ideally be logged in a standard format such as UTC to ensure it can be matched to other sources.
- Timeline of events leading up to the detection.
- Response times and actions are taken immediately following detection.

Understanding **_why it happened_** and **_how to prevent it from happening again_** are fundamental to strengthening future security. Essential points include:

- Analysing the cause (e.g., Assessing how the phishing scam was successful and the vulnerabilities exploited, if any).
- Identifying and documenting gaps in knowledge, communication, or technical defences that the incident highlighted.
- Formulating recommendations for policy updates, training enhancements, and technical measures to prevent recurrence.

The value of thorough documentation lies not only in enhancing organisational transparency but also in ensuring court admissibility. Precisely recording repeatable steps in incident response strengthens the legal standing of the actions undertaken and the evidence presented.

While one may conduct the finest analysis and possess the most compelling evidence, its value is nullified if it can't be presented in court. Thorough documentation ensures these critical insights are admissible and impactful when and where they matter most.

Standard Operating Procedures for Communicating an Incident

Establishing well-defined communication protocols before and during the early stages of an incident is vital. These protocols serve as a guide to ensure:

Having predefined channels and templates for communication can significantly reduce decision fatigue and response time during a high-pressure incident.

The importance of an Incident Response (IR) Process to handle potential detection and response capability gaps due to a lack of communication and awareness cannot be overstated. A robust IR Process:

- **Establishes a Clear Reporting Path:** Constituents are well-informed about the process to follow when they feel or think something is off, ensuring concerns are addressed promptly and effectively.
- **Defines Roles and Responsibilities:** Each member of the IR team knows their tasks and how to communicate their progress to key stakeholders.
- **Ensures Continual Updates:** Regular updates are crucial for adapting strategies as the situation evolves and keeping all parties informed.
- **Facilitates Post-Incident Review:** Effective communication before, during and after an incident contributes to a more efficient review process, identifying lessons learned and areas for improvement.

A structured communication approach is essential for bridging detection and response capabilities gaps, often caused by misunderstandings or lack of information.

Moreover, having a well-defined communication protocol and a robust IR Process is beneficial and necessary for effective incident management. These ensure that all involved parties are coordinated, informed, and prepared to respond promptly and effectively, thereby mitigating the impact of the incident and paving the way for a swift recovery.

**Reminder: Proceed with the tasks with the mindset of an incident responder, your assigned role. Focus on advancing the investigation by following established procedures and utilising your investigative skills. Your decisions and actions should align with the scenario and its objectives.
