The process of imaging a disk starts by identifying the target drive, preparing it for imaging, and then creating the image file which is later verified for integrity. This needs to be performed in an environment that allows us to perform these tasks and also ensures the process is properly logged.  

Each operating system has specific file system structures and configurations that require different imaging tools and techniques. In our scenario, we will use Linux as the OS to acquire the data and create a forensic image of a drive. The use of open-source software for image acquisition is an advantage in many cases since it can satisfy guidelines for evidential reliability that need to be fulfilled. The Linux kernel also supports many [file systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:File_systems_supported_by_the_Linux_kernel), which is a big advantage when analyzing different media types.
