[Cyber Analytics Repository](https://car.mitre.org/)

The official definition of CAR is "_The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK_® _adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools (e.g., Splunk, EQL) in its analytics. With respect to coverage, CAR is focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics, in particular with regards to their operating theory and rationale._"

Instead of further attempting to explain what CAR is, let's dive in. With our newly acquired knowledge from the previous section, we should feel comfortable and understand the information that CAR is providing to us.

Let's begin our journey by reviewing [CAR-2020-09-001: Scheduled Task - File Access](https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2020-09-001/).

Upon visiting the page, we're given a brief description of the analytics and references to ATT&CK (technique, sub-technique, and tactic).

We're also provided with Pseudocode and a query on how to search for this specific analytic within Splunk. A pseudocode is a plain, human-readable way to describe a set of instructions or algorithms that a program or system will perform.

Note the reference to Sysmon. If you're not familiar with Sysmon, check out the Sysmon [room](https://tryhackme.com/room/sysmon). 

To take full advantage of CAR, we can view the [Full Analytic List](https://car.mitre.org/analytics) or the [CAR ATT&CK® Navigator layer](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/#layerURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre-attack/car/master/docs/coverage/car_analytic_coverage_04_05_2022.json) to view all the analytics.

In the Full Analytic List view, we can see what implementations are available for any given analytic at a single glance, along with what OS platform it applies to.

(The techniques highlighted in purple are the analytics currently in CAR)

Let's look at another analytic to see a different implementation, [CAR-2014-11-004: Remote PowerShell Sessions](https://car.mitre.org/analytics/CAR-2014-11-004/).

Under Implementations, a pseudocode is provided and an EQL version of the pseudocode. EQL (pronounced as 'equal'), and it's an acronym for Event Query Language. EQL can be utilized to query, parse, and organize Sysmon event data. You can read more about this [here](https://eql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To summarize, CAR is a great place for finding analytics that takes us further than the Mitigation and Detection summaries in the ATT&CK® framework. This tool is not a replacement for ATT&CK® but an added resource.
