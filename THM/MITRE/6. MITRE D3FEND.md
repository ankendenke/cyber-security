What is this MITRE resource? Per the [D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) website, this resource is "_A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures._"

D3FEND is still in beta and is funded by the Cybersecurity Directorate of the NSA. 

D3FEND stands for Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense. 

At the time of this writing, there are 408 artifacts in the D3FEND matrix. See the below image.

Let's take a quick look at one of the D3FENDs artifacts, such as Decoy File.

As you can see, you're provided with information on what is the technique (definition), how the technique works (how it works), things to think about when implementing the technique (considerations), and how to utilize the technique (example).

Note, as with other MITRE resources, you can filter based on the ATT&CK matrix. 

Since this resource is in beta and will change significantly in future releases, we won't spend that much time on D3FEND. 

The objective of this task is to make you aware of this MITRE resource and hopefully you'll keep an eye on it as it matures in the future.
