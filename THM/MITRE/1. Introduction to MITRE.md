For those that are new to the cybersecurity field, you probably never heard of MITRE. Those of us that have been around _might_ only associate MITRE with CVEs ([**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**](https://cve.mitre.org/)) list, which is one resource you'll probably check when searching for an exploit for a given vulnerability. But MITRE researches in many areas, outside of cybersecurity, for the 'safety, stability, and well-being of our nation.'  These areas include artificial intelligence, health informatics, space security, to name a few.

From [**Mitre.org**](https://www.mitre.org/about/corporate-overview): "_At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation._"

In this room, we will focus on other projects/research that the US-based non-profit MITRE Corporation has created for the cybersecurity community, specifically:

- ATT&CK_®_ (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
- CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
- ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
- D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
- AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)
