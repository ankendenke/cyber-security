Before diving in, let's briefly discuss a few terms that you will often hear when dealing with the framework, threat intelligence, etc.

APT is an acronym for Advanced Persistent Threat. This can be considered a team/group (**_threat group_**), or even country (**_nation-state group_**), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries. The term 'advanced' can be misleading as it will tend to cause us to believe that each APT group all have some super-weapon, e.i. a zero-day exploit, that they use. That is not the case. As we will see a bit later, the techniques these APT groups use are quite common and can be detected with the right implementations in place. You can view FireEye's current list of APT groups [**here**](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html).    

TTP is an acronym for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, but what does each of these terms mean?

- The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective.
- The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
- The Procedure is how the technique is executed.

If that is not that clear now, don't worry. Hopefully, as you progress through each section, TTPs will make more sense.
