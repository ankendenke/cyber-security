The post-incident activity phase in the incident response lifecycle is a critical step that focuses on learning from the incident to enhance future response efforts and overall security posture. This phase involves thoroughly reviewing the incident, documenting lessons learned, and integrating these insights into the Incident Response Plan (IRP) developed during the preparation phase. By doing so, organisations can continuously improve their readiness and resilience against future threats.

And Back to Preparation
The preparation phase is the foundational and most crucial step both in the NIST Incident Response lifecycle and the SANS Incident Response 101, yet it is often overlooked despite its importance. Essentially, this phase involves creating a comprehensive Incident Response Plan (IRP), which is pivotal for ensuring an organisation's readiness to handle cyber security incidents effectively.

After each incident is closed, the insights coming from the post-incident activity step should be used to integrate the Incident Response Plan that was defined during the original preparation phase.

In our scenario, we could suggest the following integration to our organisation's plan:

Implementing an EDR solution able to detect the kind of threat that we just faced (crypto miners and malicious macros).
Enforcing a web-browsing control system that would prevent users from navigating to unsafe websites.
Raising awareness among employees on the potential threat of macro-enabled Office files and navigating suspicious links, for example, with mandatory training on the topic.
Discussing the approach of implementing a policy to block the execution of macros as a countermeasure, ensuring that this wouldn't disrupt legitimate business operations.
