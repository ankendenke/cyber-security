CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web-based application designed to help with various “cyber” operation tasks within your web browser. Think of it as a **Swiss Army knife** for data - like having a toolbox of different tools designed to do a specific task. These tasks range from simple encodings like **XOR** or **Base64** to complex operations like **AES encryption** or **RSA decryption**. CyberChef operates on **recipes**, a series of operations executed in order.
