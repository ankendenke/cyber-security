The boot process wakes up the whole system. It starts by initializing the system's hardware components, loading the operating system into memory, and finally allowing the user to interact with the system. In this task, we will cover the start of the boot process before the role of the MBR/GPT. The aim is to understand the basic booting of a system before we dive into the structure of the MBR/GPT and explore their forensic value.

The overall boot process of a system has multiple steps, as can be seen in the flow diagram below:

## Power-On the System

The first step of the boot process starts with pushing the power button, which sends electrical signals to the motherboard and initializes all the components. The CPU is the first component to get the electrical signals and needs some instructions to move further. The CPU fetches and executes these instructions from a chipset deployed on the motherboard. This chipset is known as BIOS/UEFI, and it contains instructions on how to get the boot process going.

**BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) and **UEFI** (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) are responsible for verifying whether all the hardware components work properly. A system can either use BIOS or UEFI firmware. The difference between them lies in their capabilities and features.

- **BIOS** has been used for decades and is still used in some hardware. It runs in the basic 16-bit mode and supports only up to 2 terabytes of disks. The most important thing to note is that BIOS supports the MBR partitioning scheme, which we will discuss later in the task.
- **UEFI** came as a replacement for BIOS, offering 32-bit and 64-bit modes with up to 9 zettabytes of disks. UEFI offers a secure boot feature to ensure integrity during the system boot process. It also offers redundancy, allowing us to recover from the backup even if the boot code is corrupted. UEFI uses a GPT partitioning scheme, unlike the MBR partitioning scheme used by BIOS.

There are several ways to check if your system uses BIOS or UEFI firmware. The process can be different depending on the operating system you use. For the Windows OS,  first open the Run dialog box by pressing `Windows+R` . Type `msinfo32` in this dialog box and press enter. This will show you the system summary. If it is running BIOS, the field named **BIOS Mode** would be shown as the **Legacy**. Otherwise, it would be **UEFI**.

## Power-On-Self-Test (POST)

The system is now powered on, and the CPU has executed instructions from the firmware (BIOS/UEFI) installed. The BIOS/UEFI then starts a Power-On-Self-Test to ensure all the system’s hardware components are working fine. You may hear a single or multiple beeps during this process in your system; this is how the BIOS/UEFI communicates any errors in the hardware components and displays the error message on the screen, e.g., keyboard not found.

## Locate the Bootable Device

After the BIOS/UEFI has performed the POST check, it is time for the BIOS/UEFI to locate bootable devices, such as SSDs, HDDs, or USBs, with the operating system installed. Once the bootable device is located, it starts reading this device. Now, here comes the role of the **MBR/****GPT**. The very first sector of the device would either contain the MBR (Master Boot Record) or the GPT (GUID Partition Table). The MBR/GPT would be taking control of the boot process from here. In the upcoming tasks, we will see how the boot process propagates from here if the MBR partitioning scheme is used and what happens if it is GPT instead.

**Note:** The method of checking your disk's partitioning scheme will differ for different operating systems. For the Windows OS, you can type `Get-Disk` in your PowerShell terminal, and it will show the partitioning schemes of the disks on your system.

The first 3 steps of the boot process that we discussed in this task were the initial steps to find the bootable disk on which the OS resides. From the first task, we imagined this disk as a building where all our data is stored, and there are multiple rooms (partitions) in this building. The next step of the boot process would be to get the map of this building. This map would be either MBR or GPT.
