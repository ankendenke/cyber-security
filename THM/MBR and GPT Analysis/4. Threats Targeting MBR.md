MBR is not that common nowadays and is replaced by GPT. This happened when the UEFI firmware (compatible with GPT), which is more efficient and redundant, replaced BIOS (compatible with MBR). However, as the MBR is still being used in some disks, it is important to understand the threat surface of the MBR.

As the MBR plays a crucial role in booting the operating system, it becomes an attractive target for attackers. The total 512 bytes of the MBR hold extreme importance for the whole system. Anybody who can play with these 512 bytes can hijack the whole system. Several types of malware are designed to target the MBR.  Let's explore some common malware leveraging the MBR to achieve their objective.

- **Bootkits:**
Bootkits are a very dangerous type of malware. Since the MBR executes before the OS starts, the bootkits craft themselves into the MBR to bypass the OS's protection mechanisms. Even complete malware removal or reinstallation of the OS cannot remove the bootkits as they reside in the MBR.

- **Ransomware:**
MBR is the first thing executed on the disk during the boot process, and the boot process heavily relies on it. Instead of encrypting the individual files of the system, attackers encrypt and modify the MBR to interrupt the boot process and display their ransom notes on the screen. Petya ransomware, detected in 2016, encrypts the MBR rather than all the disk files. Another example is the Bad Rabbit ransomware, which overwrites the original MBR with its malicious bootloader code and displays a ransom note on the screen upon reboot of the system.

- **Wiper Malware:**
This type of malware intends to corrupt the MBR to make the system unbootable. Any change in the original MBR of a disk can make the system completely unbootable. The Shamoon malware is one such malware that overwrites the MBR with random characters to make the system unbootable. In the next task, we will examine a similar case in which malware corrupted the MBR of a disk to make the system unbootable.
