Separation of privilege (SoP) is a security principle that ==divides access rights and system privileges to ensure that no single entity has all the permissions needed to access critical resources or compromise system security==. It's also known as separation of duties.

Privilege separation **requires defining and delineating employee, application, and system roles and tasks so that access is only granted to specific, discrete parts of systems or data as is necessary**. When it comes to people, every user should have unique, separate credentials for each of their different account types.
