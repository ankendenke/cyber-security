A weak password is a password that is easily guessable or can be easily cracked by attackers due to its simplicity or predictability. It is important to avoid using passwords related to personal information such as names, places, or mobile numbers. Additionally, weak passwords may have a short length, making them susceptible to brute force attacks. In order to enhance security, it is recommended to use random strings with special characters, even though they may be difficult to remember.
