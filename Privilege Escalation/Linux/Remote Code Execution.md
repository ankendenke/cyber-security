Remote Code Execution (RCE) is ==a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to run code on a remote machine without needing physical access to the device or network==. RCE is a serious threat that can lead to data loss, service disruption, and the deployment of malware. 

RCE works by exploiting flaws in how an application handles user input. Attackers can craft malicious input that the application fails to validate, allowing them to inject and execute their code on the remote system.
