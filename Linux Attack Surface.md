The [[Linux]] Attack Surface refers to all the points of interaction in a Linux system where an adversary might attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or carry out malicious activities. One of the main purposes of identifying the attack surface is to reduce the number of entry points that the attackers could potentially exploit.

Some of the key entry points that could be identified as part of the Linux Attack Surface are:

- Open ports
- Running services
- Running software or applications with vulnerabilities
- Network communication

The primary goal is to minimize the attack surface by reducing potential weaknesses from the areas the attacker could exploit. Some of the steps that are involved in achieving this goal are:

- Identifying and patching the vulnerabilities
- Minimizing the usage of unwanted services
- Check the interfaces where the user interacts
- Minimizing the publicly exposed services, applications, ports, etc
