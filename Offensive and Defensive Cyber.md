***Offensive Sec***: Offensive Sec is the process of breaking into a computer system or computer network, take advantage of software vulnerabilities and bugs, to gain control of the computer system or network.

***Defensive Sec***: Defensive Sec is the process of investigating how the computer was infected (or compromised), tracking down cybercriminals, monitoring infrastructure for malicious activity.

Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:  

1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

To beat a hacker, you will need to act like one. In defensive mode, the role is to find vulnerabilities and propose patches, as well as looking for malware and try to counter their effect on the infrastructure.

***Red Team/Penetration testers*** focus on offensive security
***Blue team*** are part of the defensive security landscape

Some of the role in Def sec:
- [[Security Operations Center]] (SOC)
- [[Threat Intelligence]]
- [[Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)]]
- Malware Analysis
