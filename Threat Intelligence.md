In this context: 
_intelligence_ refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies. 

A _threat_ is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system. Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

The purpose would be to achieve a _threat-informed defense_.

 Example adversaries include a nation-state cyber army working for political reasons and a ransomware group acting for financial purposes. Based on the company (target), we can expect adversaries.

Intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed. Data collection is done from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums.

Learning about your adversaries allows you to know their tactics, techniques, and procedures. As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the *threat actor* (adversary), predict their activity, and consequently, we will be able to mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.
