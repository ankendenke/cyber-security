All [[programming]] languages follow the same principles which R. D. Tennent initially defined:

1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness
We can read 50 books about programming, and we will understand how to read the code. This is the process of passive learning. This can be useful. However, if we need to write our own program, we have to practice active learning, which means we have to write code and test it on our own.

We know that one person cannot know everything. In this case, we have to learn how to `find`, `choose`, and `adapt` the information we need.

Occam's Razor is one of the central principles of modern scientific theory. The principle is based on the following definition:

- `The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`

Talented individuals are defined as highly efficient and perform exceptionally well in their individual fields.
Such talents, or rather the ability to solve specific problems and challenges with high efficiency, arise from the `constant or persistent` confrontation with the corresponding situations and the problems that arise.

However, it does not have to be precisely the one situation to develop talent but rather the thinking pattern to solve problems. The confrontation expands the so-called comfort zone and repertoire, which allows us to think more easily and tackle the challenge or problem. In essence, talent is a trained and adapted thought process and the associated thought patterns for specific fields and situations.
> A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

If we do not have a goal, we will stop at the first obstacle. Without a goal, we will be disoriented moving from one topic to another.

 First of all, we have to fail. It is an `unavoidable` and `essential` part of `learning`. This is one of the parts of the learning process which make us successful. Experience is built on failures. It explains that we know how to handle different and sometimes adverse situations where something does not work as expected
 
The `Pareto principle` states that with 20% of the effort, we can achieve 80% of the effect. Conversely, this means that with 80% of the effort, we can achieve the remaining 20% of the effect, which is 100% missing. However, it is essential to note that it does not apply to everything but is a general rule applied to specific areas.

The Will
Deliberate, plan, conscious action to attain a goal

From a philosophical point of view, will is defined as deciding on a particular type of action based on the motives for acting consciously.

Desire is very dependent on the belief in it. When we believe in our abilities, it relieves us of our complexes (at least from some of them), and we get access to chains of associations of our thinking, interrupted by the pressure of our fears. Let us remember and deeply internalize the following sentence:

- `Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.`

The Goal
A goal is  defined and desired endpoint of a process.

Therefore, it must be possible to determine precisely from the formulation of the goal what the desired state must be for a goal to be considered achieved.


There are many different types of goals, such as:

|||
|---|---|
|Quantitative goals|Qualitative goals|
|Complementary goals|Competing goals|
|Indifferent goals|Main goals|
|Secondary goals|and many more|


No matter what goal we have in mind, we must decide on it.

# Decision Making

A decision is, in simple terms, the choice of one of several options. All decisions are made based on the importance of the circumstances. We make decisions based on what we expect to get the most out of it. Thus, decisions are made not only rationally but also emotionally.

If we do not know what to do in one situation or another, the reason is usually that we have not gathered enough facts to make a good decision. However, once we have gathered enough data, we can better calculate what result we will achieve in the end, and based on the facts we have gathered, we open up possibilities and paths we can take.

Documentation
 The purpose of documentation is to present the information we have obtained in a comprehensible and easy way to reproduce a specific activity.

Therefore the essential characteristics of documentation are:

1. Overview
2. Structure
3. Clarity

Focus
The focus is based on our will and what we want to achieve. It can be a `conscious decision` and a `subconscious decision` guided by external influences.

`Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal`.

Attention
It can be said that attention is the perception of a specific topic with a higher level of interest in order to gather specific data and information from it.

Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals, and experiences.

Comfort
This is the feeling of well-being in the form and the attitude of risk-free behavior.

There is a so-called `Yerkes-Dodson` law, which describes the cognitive performance as a function of the level of stress/nervousness. The performance curve for this is also very individual, as it depends strongly on emotional and motivational factors and is divided into four sections.

The most used presentation of this law and the performance process is the Hebbian version.

We are in an area that we are used to and that we consider comfortable.
When we leave the so-called `comfort zone`, we enter a situation or field where we have little or no experience. This kind of uncertainty lowers our ability to think and has a powerful impact on our thought processes, which, in turn, slows us down.

Fear
Imaginary fear is an emotional state that keeps us from having the best experiences and prevents us from moving forward on the desired path.

One factor that reinforces this imaginary fear and makes us think we will fail is our previous failures.

- `The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often than the loser`.


- Talent is a strongly developed skill with high efficiency.
- Skill is the ability to manage or solve something well.
- Passion is an emotional commitment to a particular area.

Mindset
A mindset is **a series of self-perceptions or beliefs people hold about themselves**. These determine behavior, outlook and mental attitude. For example, believing you are either 'intelligent' or 'unintelligent'.
The mindset consists of thought processes we unconsciously acquire to avoid difficult situations or efforts for example.

Questioning
==The most important and most difficult thing in any situation is not the search for the right answer but the search for the right question.==

 Many people believe that searching for an answer is one of the most difficult activities that accompany them throughout their lives. However, finding the answer becomes the opposite when the question is asked correctly. It is much more challenging to ask the right questions when we do not understand the concepts or do not have any knowledge of a particular area in the first place.
The more questions we ask, the better understanding we develop of the whole picture.

What is a question?
- `A question is a sentence worded or expressed to elicit information.`
