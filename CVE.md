We can think of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program as a dictionary of vulnerabilities. It provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and security issues in software and hardware products. Each vulnerability is assigned a CVE ID with a standardized format like `CVE-2024-29988`. This unique identifier (CVE ID) ensures that everyone from security researchers to vendors and IT professionals is referring to the same vulnerability, [CVE-2024-29988](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29988) in this case.

The MITRE Corporation maintains the CVE system. For more information and to search for existing CVEs, visit the [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/) website.
