Hereâ€™s an advanced [[Linux]] bash script that performs basic network reconnaissance and security checks. The script will:

- Perform port scanning using `nmap`.
- Check for open ports on a given target.
- Perform a basic vulnerability scan.
- Log the results for further analysis.

This script can be adapted and expanded based on specific needs.

### Explanation of Key Functions:

1. **Port Scan (`nmap`)**:
   - Scans the target for open ports.
   - Results are saved in `nmap_scan_target.txt`.

2. **SSL Vulnerability Check**:
   - Uses `sslscan` to check SSL/TLS vulnerabilities on the given domain.

3. **Open Port Check**:
   - Uses `nc` (netcat) to check if a specific port is open.

4. **HTTP Header Analysis**:
   - Fetches the HTTP headers for a given URL using `curl`.
   - Saves the result in `http_headers_url.txt`.

5. **Basic Vulnerability Scan**:
   - Checks for specific headers like `X-Content-Type-Options` and `X-Frame-Options`, which can help mitigate MIME-type sniffing and clickjacking attacks.

### Requirements:
- `nmap`: For port scanning.
- `curl`: To fetch HTTP headers.
- `sslscan`: To check SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.
- `nc` (netcat): For checking open ports.

Make sure to run the script with root privileges to allow full functionality, especially for network scans (`nmap`). 

You can extend this script further based on your cybersecurity needs, such as adding more vulnerability checks, automating reporting, or integrating it with other security tools.
