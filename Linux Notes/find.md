***Examples***
- Find a specific file in my current directory
```
find . -name sample.txt
```
- Search Files with a pattern using find
```
find / -name *.txt
```
- Find and confirm a deletion for a file in a directory named 'Med' in the current directory
```
find ./Med -name sample.txt -exec rm -i {} \;
```
  Note: when this command is entered, a prompt will ask a confirmation from the user.
- Search for an empty file in the directory 'Med' in the current directory
```
find ./Med -empty
```
- Search for files with specific permissions
```
find / -perm 664
```
- Display directory hierarchy
```
find ./ -type d
```
- Search Text Within Multiple Files Using `find`
```
find ./ -type f -name "*.txt" -exec grep 'Geek'  {} \;
```
- Find Files by When They Were Modified
```
find /path/to/search -mtime -7
```
To find files modified within the last 7 days
- Use Grep to Find Files Based on Content
Combining find and [[grep]] commands, we can search for pattern based on their content
```
find . -type f -exec grep -l "pattern" {} \;
```
