The `lsof` (List Open Files) command in [[Linux]] is a powerful utility used to list information about files that are opened by processes. Since everything in Linux is treated as a file (e.g., network connections, devices, pipes, etc.), `lsof` is a valuable tool for Linux incident response in cybersecurity. It allows investigators to see which files are open, by which processes, and can provide insights into potential malicious activity, compromised files, or unauthorized access.

In this tutorial, we will go through several practical uses of `lsof` in the context of incident response.

### 1. **Basic Usage of `lsof`**
The command `lsof` by itself lists all open files in the system. Given that it can produce a lot of output, it's useful to apply filters to focus on the most relevant information during incident response.

```bash
lsof
```

Output fields include:
- **COMMAND**: The name of the command that opened the file.
- **PID**: Process ID.
- **USER**: The owner of the process.
- **FD**: File descriptor (can indicate type such as regular file, network socket, etc.).
- **TYPE**: File type (e.g., REG for regular file, DIR for directory, CHR for character special file).
- **NAME**: Name of the file.

### 2. **Identifying Suspicious Network Connections**
One of the most important uses of `lsof` in incident response is to identify network connections that may indicate malicious activity, such as unauthorized connections to remote systems.

To list open network files (sockets) for TCP and UDP connections:
```bash
lsof -i
```

For more detail, such as listing specific ports:
```bash
lsof -i :80  # Show processes using port 80 (HTTP)
lsof -i :443 # Show processes using port 443 (HTTPS)
```

You can also list all network connections on specific protocols:
```bash
lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN   # List all listening TCP connections
lsof -iUDP                # List all UDP connections
```

#### Example: Finding Malicious Connections
If you suspect a process is communicating with an external IP, you can search by IP address or port:
```bash
lsof -i @192.168.1.100     # Show connections to/from IP 192.168.1.100
lsof -iTCP:4444            # Show processes using port 4444 (often used by reverse shells)
```

### 3. **Finding Files Opened by a Specific Process**
In incident response, you may need to investigate what files a suspicious process has opened. This can help identify if it is accessing sensitive files or performing unauthorized operations.

To find files opened by a specific process (e.g., with PID 1234):
```bash
lsof -p 1234
```

You can combine this with other utilities (like `ps` or `top`) to track suspicious processes. For example, if you find a suspicious process running via `ps aux`, you can then use `lsof` to investigate it further.

#### Example: Listing Files for Malware or Compromised Process
```bash
ps aux | grep suspicious_process_name
lsof -p <PID>
```

### 4. **Checking Which Processes are Using a Specific File**
Sometimes you might want to know which processes are using a specific file. This could help you identify unauthorized access to critical files, like sensitive logs or configuration files.

For example, to see which processes are using `/etc/passwd`:
```bash
lsof /etc/passwd
```

This will list any processes that have the file open, which can help you determine if an attacker is trying to modify system credentials.

### 5. **Tracking Files Opened by a Specific User**
In incident response, it can be useful to see which files are being accessed by a specific user, especially if that user is suspected of malicious activity or if you're investigating privilege escalation.

To list all files opened by a user:
```bash
lsof -u username
```

For instance, if a malicious actor has gained access to a low-privileged user account, this command will help you monitor what files or processes the attacker is interacting with.

### 6. **Detecting Deleted Files Still in Use**
Attackers sometimes delete files after executing them to cover their tracks. However, even after deletion, the file may remain open in the system as long as the process using it has not closed the file descriptor.

To find processes using deleted files:
```bash
lsof | grep '(deleted)'
```

This command can show hidden evidence of a malicious binary that’s been executed but removed from the filesystem. 

### 7. **Identifying Malware Persistence with Network Connections**
Malicious software often attempts to persist by opening unauthorized network connections. Use `lsof` to detect all established network connections and review any that seem suspicious:

```bash
lsof -i -nP
```
Here, `-n` prevents hostnames from being resolved (which can slow down the output), and `-P` prevents service names from being displayed (showing port numbers instead).

### 8. **Monitoring Remote Access Tools**
Many attackers use tools like `ssh`, `netcat`, or reverse shells to maintain remote access. You can use `lsof` to monitor for these tools:
```bash
lsof -c ssh  # Shows all ssh sessions
lsof -c nc   # Shows all netcat sessions (commonly used in reverse shells)
```

### 9. **Log Analysis for Files**
To identify which files a process has opened, especially for suspicious ones, use `lsof` to check files being accessed and potentially written to:

```bash
lsof -p <PID> -o
```
This shows file offsets which can indicate whether a file is being modified or written to, possibly useful in detecting data exfiltration.

### 10. **Killing a Suspicious Process**
Once you’ve identified a suspicious process and confirmed its malicious activity, you may need to terminate it as part of your incident response strategy. You can use the PID identified by `lsof` to kill the process:
```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

### 11. **Common Options for `lsof` in Incident Response**
- `-i [protocol]`: Displays network files associated with TCP, UDP, etc.
- `-p <PID>`: Lists all files opened by a specific process.
- `-u <username>`: Lists all files opened by a specific user.
- `+d <directory>`: Lists files opened within a specific directory.
- `-r`: Continuously run `lsof` in intervals, useful for real-time monitoring.
  
### Practical Scenario: Detecting a Reverse Shell

Let’s say you suspect a reverse shell on your system. First, you could list all network connections and filter for suspicious ones:

```bash
lsof -i :4444  # Port often used by reverse shells
```

Then, identify the process associated with this connection:
```bash
lsof -iTCP:4444
```

Finally, terminate the suspicious process:
```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Conclusion
`lsof` is a versatile and powerful tool for incident response, helping cybersecurity professionals quickly identify suspicious activity, such as unauthorized file access, malicious network connections, or hidden processes. By combining `lsof` with other utilities and analytical techniques, you can enhance your ability to detect and respond to security incidents on Linux systems.
