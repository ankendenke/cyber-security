You can run tcpdump without providing any arguments; however, this is only useful to test that you have it installed! In any real scenario, we must be specific about what to listen to, where to write, and how to display the packets.

Specify the Network Interface
The first thing to decide is which network interface to listen to using -i INTERFACE. You can choose to listen on all available interfaces using -i any; alternatively, you can specify an interface you want to listen on, such as -i eth0.

A command such as ip address show (or merely ip a s) would list the available network interfaces. In the terminal below, we see one network card, ens5, in addition to the loopback address.

Terminal
user@TryHackMe$ ip a s
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
[...]
2: ens5: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 9001 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
[...]
Save the Captured Packets
In many cases, you should check the captured packets again later. This can be achieved by saving to a file using -w FILE. The file extension is most commonly set to .pcap. The saved packets can be inspected later using another program, such as Wireshark. You won’t see the packets scrolling when you choose the -w option.

Read Captured Packets from a File
You can use Tcpdump to read packets from a file by using -r FILE. This is very useful for learning about protocol behaviour. You can capture network traffic over a suitable time frame to inspect a specific protocol, then read the captured file while applying filters to display the packets you are interested in. Furthermore, it might be a packet capture file that contains a network attack that took place, and you inspect it to analyze the attack.

Limit the Number of Captured Packets
You can specify the number of packets to capture by specifying the count using -c COUNT. Without specifying a count, the packet capture will continue till you interrupt it, for example, by pressing CTRL-C. Depending on your goal, you only need a limited number of packets.

Don’t Resolve IP Addresses and Port Numbers
Tcpdump will resolve IP addresses and print friendly domain names where possible. To avoid making such DNS lookups, you can use the -n argument. Similarly, if you don’t want port numbers to be resolved, such as 80 being resolved to http, you can use the -nn to stop both DNS and port number lookups. Consider the following example shown in the terminal below. We captured and displayed five packets without resolving the IP addresses.

Terminal
user@TryHackMe$ sudo tcpdump -i ens5 -c 5 -n

5 packets captured
6 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
Produce (More) Verbose Output
If you want to print more details about the packets, you can use -v to produce a slightly more verbose output. According to the Tcpdump manual page (man tcpdump), the addition of -v will print “the time to live, identification, total length and options in an IP packet” among other checks. The -vv will produce more verbose output; the -vvv will provide even more verbosity; check the manual page for details.

Summary and Examples
The table below provides a summary of the command line options that we covered.

Command	Explanation
tcpdump -i INTERFACE	Captures packets on a specific network interface
tcpdump -w FILE	Writes captured packets to a file
tcpdump -r FILE	Reads captured packets from a file
tcpdump -c COUNT	Captures a specific number of packets
tcpdump -n	Don’t resolve IP addresses
tcpdump -nn	Don’t resolve IP addresses and don’t resolve protocol numbers
tcpdump -v	Verbose display; verbosity can be increased with -vv and -vvv
Consider the following examples:

tcpdump -i eth0 -c 50 -v captures and displays 50 packets by listening on the eth0 interface, which is a wired Ethernet, and displays them verbosely.
tcpdump -i wlo1 -w data.pcap captures packets by listening on the wlo1 interface (the WiFi interface) and writes the packets to data.pcap. It will continue till the user interrupts the capture by pressing CTRL-C.
tcpdump -i any -nn captures packets on all interfaces and displays them on screen without domain name or protocol resolution.
