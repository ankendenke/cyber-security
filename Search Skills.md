Evaluation of Search Results
Points to consider:
- **Source**: Check if the source is authoritative, credible or reputable or subject matter
- **Evidence and reasoning**: Check whether the claims are backed by credible evidence and logical reasoning. We are seeking hard facts and solid arguments.
- **Objectivity and bias**: Evaluate whether the information is presented impartially and rationally, reflecting multiple perspectives. Not interested on individuals pushing an agenda, promote a product or attack rivals.
- **Corroboration and consistency**: Validate the presented information by corroboration from multiple independent sources. Check if other sources are available and can have a similar opinion on the same subject.
